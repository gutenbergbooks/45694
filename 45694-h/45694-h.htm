<h2><a name="THE_CURRENCY_EXTENSION_ACT_OF_NATURE" id="THE_CURRENCY_EXTENSION_ACT_OF_NATURE">THE CURRENCY EXTENSION ACT OF NATURE.</a></h2>


<p>Whoever has examined with attention
the past annals of mankind,
must have become aware that the
greatest and most important revolutions
that have occurred in human
affairs have originated in the variations
which from time to time have
taken place in the supply of the
precious metals which could be obtained
for the use of man. As they
constitute, by the universal consent of
the world, the common medium of
exchange and measure of value among
nations, their plenty or scarcity has
an immediate and powerful influence
upon the remuneration of industry
and the activity of the working-classes
in all countries. According
as they are increasing or diminishing,
abundant or awanting, is
the condition of the people prosperous
or calamitous&mdash;the national
prospects bright or gloomy. No
amount of human exertion, no efforts
of human patriotism, can sustain the
national fortunes for any length of
time, or diffuse general and enduring
prosperity among the people, if the
existing medium of exchange is below
what their numbers and transactions
require; because, in such a case,
prices are constantly declining, credit
is liable to periodical and ruinous
contractions, and industry, on an average
of years, ceases to meet with its
due reward. No calamities are insuperable,
no dangers insurmountable,
when a currency is provided adequate
to the wants of men, and capable of
extension in proportion to their necessities;
because, in such a case, prices
are rising or remunerative, and individual
effort, stimulated by the prospect
of an adequate return, becomes
universal, and acts powerfully and
decisively upon the general welfare of
society and the issue of the national
fortunes.</p>

<p>The two greatest revolutions which
have taken place in the annals of the
species, and which have for ever left
their traces on the fortunes of mankind,
have arisen from the successive
diminution and increase in the supply
of the precious metals for the use of
the world. There can be no doubt
that the decline and fall of the Roman
empire&mdash;so long and falsely ascribed
to its latter extension, plebeian slavery,
and patrician corruption&mdash;was
in reality mainly owing to the failure
in the mines of Spain and Greece,
from which the precious metals in
ancient times were chiefly obtained,
joined to the unrestricted importation
of grain from Egypt and Libya,
which ruined the profit of the
harvests and destroyed the agriculture
of Italy and Greece, at once
paralysing industry, and rendering
taxes overwhelming.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We know
now to what the failure of these
mines, attended with such portentous
results, was owing. It was to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>exhaustion of the auriferous veins in
Spain and Greece near the surface,
from long-continued working, and the
extreme <i>hardness of the rock</i> in which
they were imbedded farther down,
which seems to be a general law of
nature all over the world,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and which
rendered working them, to any considerable
depth, no longer a source of
profit. On the other hand, the prodigious
start which Europe took
during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, and which has implanted
the European race for ever in the
new hemisphere, is well known to
have been mainly owing to the discovery
of the mines of Mexico and
Peru, and the continual rise of prices
during nearly two centuries, which
took place all over the world, from
the constant and increasing influx of
the precious metals drawn out of their
rich strata.</p>

<p>The greatest and most momentous
contests which have taken place
among nations, have been in a great
degree determined by the discovery or
use, by one of the belligerents, of an
expansive currency, to which the
other was for a time a stranger. The
most memorable strife in antiquity,
that between Rome and Carthage, on
which depended whether Europe or
Africa was to become the mistress of
the civilised world, was in reality
determined by a great extension of
the Italian circulating medium during
the second Punic war; and that
dreadful contest was less brought to
a successful issue by the firmness of
the senate or the arms of Scipio, than
by the wisdom of a decree which
virtually, at the crisis of its fate,
doubled the currency of the Roman
republic.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The Transatlantic revolution
was brought to a successful issue
in the same way; and the independence
of the United States is less
to be ascribed to the imbecility of
British counsels, or the wisdom of
American generalship, than to the
establishment of a paper currency,
which sustained the efforts of the
insurgent states when they had no
other resources wherewith to maintain
the contest. It was the assignats,
as all the world knows, that set on
foot those prodigious armies which,
amidst the destruction of all private
fortunes, enabled France, during the
Reign of Terror, to repel the assault
of all the European powers; and the
coalition which at last overturned
the empire of Napoleon was sustained
by a vast system of paper currency,
issued in 1813 in Germany, which,
guaranteed by the four Allied powers,
passed as gold from the Atlantic
Ocean to the wall of China, and
arrayed all the armies of Europe in
dense and disciplined battalions on
the banks of the Rhine. Of what
incalculable importance it was may
be judged of by the dreadful straits to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>which Wellington, for five previous
years, had been reduced by its want.
Great Britain emerged victorious from
the strife, chiefly from the powerful influence
of the same omnipotent agent.
Vain would have been the constancy
of Pitt, the genius of Nelson, or the
wisdom of Wellington, if the paper
currency, established in 1797, had
not given her people the sinews of
war, and the means of illimitable
industry, when the Continent was shut
to her commerce, and the whole
precious metals were drained away
by the necessities of Continental warfare.
Nor have the effects of the
opposite system, pursued since the
peace, been less striking and momentous;
for the contraction of
British currency to one half of its
former dimensions, by the bills of 1819
and 1844, has brought about the
dreadful panics of 1825, 1837, and
1847, induced by the decline of prices
and the sufferings it occasioned. The
English revolution of 1832 transferred
power in the British islands
exclusively to the inhabitants of
towns, and spread such misery through
the rural population, that <i>three hundred
thousand</i> emigrants now annually
leave the British islands for Transatlantic
or Australian shores.</p>

<p>As the expansion or contraction of
the circulating medium is thus an
agent of such prodigious power and
irresistible weight, both upon the fortunes
of particular states and the
general progress of the species, so it
will be found upon examination that
it is by a withholding or letting loose
the fertilising flood, that Providence
appears often to act most directly and
decisively upon human affairs. When
a nation has performed its mission,
and is to make room for other actors
on the great stage of the world, if its
power has rendered conquest by a
foreign enemy impossible, a contraction
of its domestic currency paralyses
its internal strength, and renders dissolution,
at no distant period, a matter
of certainty. If a great start is
prepared for human industry, if new
continents are laid open to its energies,
and an unusual impulse communicated
to its activity by the development
of social and democratic passions,
a vast addition is suddenly
made to its metallic resources, and
the increased numbers or enhanced
efforts of mankind are amply sustained
by the newly opened treasures of
the reserves of nature. Rome, impregnable
to the assaults of undisciplined
barbarians, yielded, at the
appointed season, to the contraction
of its domestic currency, which rendered
the maintenance of armaments
adequate to the public defence a
matter of impossibility in the later
days of the empire; and when the
discovery of the compass, of the art
of printing, and of the new hemisphere,
had at once given a vast
impulse to European activity, and
provided new and boundless fields for
its exertion, the mines of Potosi and
Mexico were suddenly thrown open,
and nature provided a suitable reward
for all this enhanced effort by
the continually rising price of its produce.</p>

<p>That a period of equal, perhaps
greater activity, than that which
followed the discoveries of Columbus,
would succeed the outbreak of the
social passions that occasioned the
French Revolution, has long been
familiar to the thinking part of men,
and unequivocal proofs of the reality
of the change may be seen in every
direction around us. But sufficient
attention has not hitherto been paid
to the extraordinary encouragement
which this increased mental energy
has received, from the facilities which
have been placed at its disposal by the
<i>mechanical</i> discoveries of the last half
century. Yet are they such as to
throw all past discoveries into the
shade, and give an impulse to human
affairs which has scarcely been exceeded
since the first separation of
the dwellers in cities and the sojourners
in the fields. The steam-engine
has wrought these prodigies.
Applied to mechanical invention, and
the moving of machinery, it has multiplied
tenfold the powers of urban
industry, elevated the districts possessing
the necessary fuel to the
clouds, cast down places once the
seats of commercial greatness, but
destitute of that essential element
in modern manufacturing energy, to
the dust. Applied to the propelling
of vessels, it has more than halved
the breadth of the ocean, rendered
navigable against the current the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
greatest rivers, sent the colonists of
Europe in countless multitudes <i>up</i> the
streams of the New World, and provided
an entrance for civilised man
into the greatest continents by the
very magnitude of the waters which
flow down from their inaccessible
mountains, or are fed in their marshy
plains. Applied to travelling by land,
it has diminished distance to a third&mdash;brought
the capital of every civilised
state into close proximity to its most
distant provinces; while the simultaneous
discovery of the electric
telegraph has rendered the communication
of intelligence all but instantaneous,
and made the circulation of
ideas and, it is to be feared, also of
passions, as rapid over a mighty empire
as heretofore it was in the streets
of a crowded capital.</p>

<p>When nature communicated this
vast impulse to human activity, and
placed these mighty instruments in
the hands of men, she was not unmindful
of the extended field for
industry which their enlarged numbers
and increased energies would require.
The plain of the Mississippi, the
garden of the world, containing
a million of square miles, or six times
the area of France, was thrown open
to their enterprise. Steam power propelled
a thousand vessels through the
thick network of natural arteries which
in every direction penetrate its vast
and fertile plains. In 1790, five thousand
Anglo-Saxons were settled in this
magnificent wilderness; now their
numbers exceed <i>eight millions</i>. Australia
has opened its vast prairies,
New Zealand its fertile vales, to
European enterprise. The boundless
plains of Central Russia and Southern
Siberia, afforded inexhaustible resources
to the rapidly increasing
Muscovite population; and an empire
which already possesses in Europe
and Asia sixty-six million inhabitants,
can without apprehension contemplate
a continuance of its present rate
of increase for centuries to come.
The Andes even have been passed;
the Rocky Mountains surmounted;
and on the reverse of their gigantic
piles new states, peopled by the
Anglo-Saxon race, are arising, and
increasing with unheard-of rapidity,
in regions rivalling Italy in the
variety and riches of their productions,
and exceeding it tenfold in the
magnitude of their extent. Proportionate
to the wants and necessities of
mankind, in an age of such intellectual
and physical activity, has been the
hitherto untrodden fields which the
beneficence of nature has laid open to
their industry.</p>

<p>These advantages, however, great
and unbounded as they are, have
been, till very recently, counterbalanced,
and perhaps more than
counterbalanced, by the <i>serious decrease</i>
which, for the greater part of
the period that has elapsed since
the peace of 1815, has been going
on, from the effect of human violence
or folly, in the <i>circulating medium of
the globe</i>. The South American revolution
at once almost destroyed the
working of the mines of Mexico and
Peru: the annual produce of those
mines sank from &pound;10,000,000, to which,
according to Humboldt, it had risen
prior to 1810, to less than &pound;3,000,000.
The diminution in the supply of the
precious metals for the use of the
globe, from the effects of this most
calamitous revolution, which Great
Britain did so much to promote, was,
during the thirty years which elapsed
from 1810 to 1840, certainly not less
than &pound;150,000,000 sterling. Contemporaneous
with this immense reduction,
took place the great contraction
of the paper currency of Great
Britain, the commercial heart of the
globe, which was reduced by the bill
of 1819 from &pound;60,000,000, which it
had reached in 1814, to little more
than &pound;30,000,000, its average since
that time. These two great causes
of decrease, operating simultaneously
during a period of general peace,
unbroken industry, great increase in
population both in Europe and America,
and a vast addition to the transactions
and mercantile dealings of
men in every part of the world, produced
that universal and unlooked-for
decline of prices which has been
everywhere felt as so discouraging to
industry, and nowhere so much so
as in the highly taxed and deeply
indebted realm of Great Britain. It
was the exact converse of the general
and long-continued prosperity
which the progressive rise of prices
consequent on the discovery of the
South American mines produced during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
It was apparently the commencement
of a long and disastrous
period of rise in the value of money,
and fall in the price of every species of
produce, similar to that which, in the
first four centuries of the Christian
era, crushed the industry and paralysed
the strength of the Roman
Empire, and at length prostrated the
dominion of the legions before the
arms of an untutored and barbarous
enemy.</p>

<p>It is now ascertained, therefore, by
the only sure guide in political science&mdash;experience&mdash;that
if no addition to
the circulating medium of the globe
had been made at a time when so immense
an increment was going forward
in the numbers and transactions of
the most active part of mankind, consequences
the most disastrous to human
industry and happiness <i>must</i> have
taken place. If&mdash;when the United
States, with their population of
25,000,000 doubling every twenty-five
years, and Russia, with its population
of 66,000,000 doubling every forty
years, and Great Britain, with its population
of 29,000,000 doubling in
about the same time, and its exports
and imports tripling in thirty years,
were in a state of full and undiminished
activity&mdash;there had been no addition
made to the circulating medium of the
globe, it is difficult to estimate the
amount of embarrassment and distress
which must have become all but universal.
If the circulating medium of
the earth had <i>remained stationary</i>, or
gone on receiving only its wonted
annual increment, when so prodigious
an addition was going forward in the
numbers and transactions of men, a
universal and progressive fall of prices
must have ensued. The remuneration
of industry must have been halved&mdash;the
weight of debts and taxes doubled.
The fatal increase in the value and
power of riches, so truly felt and
loudly complained of in the declining
days of the Roman empire, would have
been everywhere experienced. A
<i>money famine</i> would have been universally
felt; and, paradoxical as it may
appear, dear-bought experience has
now taught us that such a famine is
attended with more disastrous, because
more widely spread and irremovable,
consequences, than even a
shortcoming in the supply of food for
the use of man. The latter may be
removed by increased rural activity
and a good harvest in a single year.
But the former is susceptible of no
such remedy. On the contrary, the
augmented activity which it brings
on, from the general and pinching
suffering with which it is attended,
only tends to aggravate the common
distress, because it multiplies the
transactions in which money as a
medium of exchange is indispensable,
and consequently makes its scarcity
in proportion to the existing demand
be more severely felt.</p>

<p>To this must be added another and
most important cause, which operated
since the peace of 1815 in withdrawing
the precious metals from the globe,
arising from the very scarcity of these
metals themselves. The addition
which their enhanced value made to
the riches of the affluent was so great,
that it led to a rapid and most important
increase in the consumption of
gold and silver in articles of luxury.
Gold and silver plate, jewels, and other
ornaments set in gold, became general
among the richer classes, and to an
extent unprecedented since the fall of
the Roman empire. Gilding was employed
so much in furniture, the frames
of pictures, the roofs of rooms, carriages,
and other articles of state or
show, as to withdraw a considerable
part of that the most precious of the
precious metals from the monetary
circulation. The scarcer gold and
silver became, the more was this direction
of a large portion of it increased,
because the richer did the fortunate few
who possessed amassed capital become
from the daily decline in the price of
all other articles of merchandise. This
effect was most conspicuous in ancient
Rome in its latter days, where, while
the legions dwindled into cohorts from
the impossibility of finding funds to
pay them in large numbers, and the
fields of Italy became desolate from
the impossibility of obtaining a remunerating
price for their produce, the
gold and silver vases, statues, and ornaments
amassed in the hands of the
wealthy patricians in Rome, Constantinople,
Alexandria, and the other
great cities of the empire, so prodigiously
increased, that, with the currency,
which formed but a small part of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
amount, their value is estimated by
Gibbon at the almost incredible
amount of &pound;350,000,000 sterling of
our money.</p>

<p>Bills of exchange and paper money,
which have become known and
general only in modern Europe,
might have gone far to mitigate these
disastrous consequences in particular
states, or even, if conducted with
prudence and regulated by wisdom,
might in some places have altogether
prevented them. But as
paper currency is a new element of
surpassing power and efficacy, but
recently introduced into common use
among men, the principles on which
it should be regulated are far from
being generally understood. Even if
understood, it requires for its due regulation
a combination of wisdom and
self-denial that can rarely be looked
for among the rulers of mankind. The
fundamental principles on which its
due regulation must be rested&mdash;that
of being based on <i>certain and available
property of some kind</i>, and of being
capable of <i>extension</i> in proportion to
the increase in the numbers and transactions
of men, and the abstraction of
the precious metals forming the medium
of international circulation, and
yet duly restrained and over-issue
prevented&mdash;were successively overlooked
by the greatest and most enlightened
nations of the world. Issued
in unbounded profusion in France
during the fervour of the Revolution
and the terrors of European invasion,
with no real basis of available property
on which to rest, the assignats
produced, simultaneously with the
prodigious armaments which saved
the country, an unheard-of confusion
among the transactions and obligations
of men, and destroyed in a few
years the whole capital of that great
country, the accumulated savings of
centuries of industry. Contracted
with equal rapidity from the influence
of the opposite set of interests in Great
Britain after the peace, the paper circulation
of the British Empire was
rendered the instrument of destruction
of property as great, and misery as
widespread and universal, among its
inhabitants, as the assignats or confiscations
of the Convention. Adopted
with heedless eagerness, and without
any adequate safeguards, at one
time in America, and checked at another
with precipitate and imprudent
severity, four-fifths of the wealth of
the United States were in a few years
swept away by the fearful oscillation
of prices consequent on these violent
changes. And although wisdom and
prudence could easily have devised a
system of paper currency which, entirely
based upon available property
of some kind, and therefore perfectly
secure, was yet capable of expansion
in proportion to the increase of the
numbers and transactions of men, and
the temporary abstraction of the precious
metals from a particular country
by the mutations of commerce or the
necessities of war, yet it was evident
that no such wise and patriotic system
was to be anticipated, till a vast amount
of general suffering had enlightened the
majority of men on the subject. Least
of all could it be hoped for in Great
Britain, where the increase and weight
of the moneyed interests, and the consequent
determination to enhance the
value of money, without any regard
to its effects on the remuneration of
industry, had become such, that no
other interest in the State, nor even
all other interests allied, were able to
make head against it.</p>

<p>The future destinies of mankind, and
of this country in particular, seemed,
therefore, to be involved in clouds and
darkness; nor did any means appear
to be within the bounds of possibility
by which the difficulties which beset or
awaited industry could be obviated.
The greater the efforts made by industry,
it was plain the greater would be
the distress in which it would be involved;
because an increase in the
transactions of men required an augmentation
in the circulating medium
by which they were to be conducted;
and an addition to the produce of labour,
while the currency was fixed or
declining, only rendered its remuneration
less. The whole object of
statesmen and legislators, both in
Great Britain and America, had come
to be to cheapen everything, and raise
the value of money by contracting its
amount&mdash;augmenting instead of relieving
the general distress arising from
the inadequacy of the existing circulating
medium for the enlarged wants
and numbers of men. The evil seemed
to be beyond the reach of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
remedy; for in the only country in
which a remedy could be effectually
applied, the moneyed interests had become
so powerful, that Government
was set chiefly on measures which, for
the sake of private profit, most grievously
aggravated it. But Providence
is wiser than man: Nature is seldom
awanting in the end to those who are
suffering from the faults of others.
A few bands of American squatters
wandered into Texas&mdash;a war of aggression
on the part of the United States
succeeded to make good the settlement&mdash;a
serious contest took place
with Mexico&mdash;the Anglo-Saxon race
asserted their wonted superiority over
the Castilian&mdash;<span class="smcap">California</span> was
wrested from them&mdash;and by the ultimate
effects of that conquest some
of the greatest evils inflicted by
human selfishness or folly were alleviated,
and the destinies of the world
were changed!</p>

<p>It is a striking proof how much the
fortunes of men are in their own
hands, and how vain are the choicest
gifts of nature if not seconded by the
vigour and industry of those for whom
they are intended, that the rich auriferous
veins, the discovery of which
has been attended with such important
effects, and is destined to avert so
many evils arising from the absurd
legislation or selfish desires of men
in recent times, had been for three
hundred years in the possession of the
Spaniards, but they had never found
them out! The gold was there, under
their feet, in such quantities that its
excavation, as will immediately appear,
is adequate to double the annual
supply of the precious metals for the
use of man over the whole world; but
they never took the trouble to turn it
up! It was so near the surface, and
so accessible, being mixed with the
alluvial sand and gravel of the country,
that it was first discovered in the
cutting a common mill-course through
a garden, and has since been obtained
almost entirely by common labourers
digging holes not deeper than ordinary
graves through the level surface of the
alluvial deposit of the mountains.
They had never attempted agricultural
operations, nor thought of an
improvement which would have led to
its detection. The Spaniards, as all
the world knows, and as their history
in every age has demonstrated, were
passionately desirous of gold; and
from the days of Columbus they had
been familiar with a tradition or report
among the native Indians, that there
existed beyond the mountains in the
far west a country in which gold was
as plentiful as the sand on the seashore,
and was to be had simply for
the trouble of taking it. It was all
true it was there, mixed in large quantities
with the alluvial deposit of the
mountains; yet during three hundred
years that they held the country, they
never found it out! A single ditch
in any part of the flat region, which
is above three hundred miles long and
forty or fifty broad, would have revealed
the treasure, but they never
took the trouble to cut it. Before the
Anglo-Saxons had been there three
months, they had discovered the riches
lying below their feet. Such is the
difference of races! It is easy to see
to which is destined the sceptre of the
globe.</p>

<p>It is impossible as yet to say with
positive certainty what is the amount
of gold which may be obtained for a
long period from this auriferous region;
but it is already evident that it
will be very great&mdash;much greater than
was at first anticipated. The following
extract, from the great and able
Free-Trade organ, the <i>Times</i>, of Nov.
19, 1850, will show what amount has
been realised and exported from San
Francisco last year, and what may be
anticipated in the next:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Some estimates have lately been
formed of the shipments of gold received
in Europe from California to the present
time, which, we believe, may be regarded
as tolerably accurate, and according to
which the amount is about &pound;3,300,000.
On the other side, up to the end of September,
the receipts at the two mints of
the United States had been about
31,000,000 dols., or &pound;6,200,000. Since
that time we have had advices of farther
arrivals at New York and New Orleans
amounting to &pound;500,000. An aggregate
is consequently formed of exactly
&pound;10,000,000. To this must be added, in
order to estimate the total production,
not only the amounts which have found
their way to China, Manilla, Australia,
Oregon, the Sandwich Islands, the States
of Spanish America, &amp;c., but also the total
which has been retained in California for
the purposes of currency. The population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
in that country now ranges somewhere
between 200,000 and 300,000, and
although a considerable amount of silver
dollars have been imported, the bulk of
the circulation is believed still to be in
the form of gold-dust or of gold tokens.
If the 250,000 persons possess, on an
average, &pound;10 a-piece, we have a sum of
&pound;2,500,000; and, looking at the expense
of a week's maintenance in the country,
as well as the large quantities constantly
in transit, as well as the reserves, which,
as was shown by the last advices, the various
deposit-houses are compelled to retain
to meet sudden runs, it is probable
that this is under the real total. Taking
all points into consideration, it may, therefore,
be assumed that the whole which
has been raised is equal to at least
&pound;13,000,000 sterling. Of this production,
according to recent official returns
from the United States, nearly four-fifths
have taken place during the present year.
Of 25,966,817 dols. received in the United
States Mint at Philadelphia, up to the
end of September last, only 44,177 dols.
had arrived in 1848, and 5,481,430 dols.
in 1849, while the quantity in 1850 had
been 20,441,210 dols. The same proportions
would probably prevail with regard
to the sums distributed to other places;
and we are, therefore, led to the supposition
that the export this year has already
actually reached upwards of &pound;10,000,000,
although the results of two additional
months have yet to be known. It will be
observed, consequently, that the unexpected
feature which has hitherto attended
the progress of this new region&mdash;namely,
that almost all the accounts from it, although
deemed exaggerations at first, have
proved ultimately to have been understatements&mdash;is
still presented. At the
commencement of 1850 the most sanguine
expectations that were formed in any
direction fixed its probable yield at
&pound;10,000,000; and not only has this been
exceeded, but each quarter of the year
has thus far shown an increase of nearly
half upon the amount gathered in the
preceding one. Thus the receipts at
Philadelphia, for the first three months,
were 4,370,714 dols., while they were
6,920,496 dols. for the second, and again
9,250,000 dols. for the third. This rate
of augmentation coincides with the influx
of population, and, as the emigration to
the country is certain to be continued
until the remuneration it affords for labour
is brought to a level with the advantages
offered elsewhere, there is no reason,
so long as we are without accounts of an
apparent limit to the field of operations,
to anticipate anything else than a steady
continuance of an improving ratio. So
far from a limit having yet been found,
each fresh exploration seems to develope
new and more favourable localities, and
an extended discovery of dry diggings
lately alleged to have been made, together
with the steps in progress elsewhere to
crush the mountain ore by machinery, appears
to hold out the prospect that, even
with the approach of winter, there will
scarcely be a suspension of the prevailing
activity."&mdash;<i>Times, Nov. 19, 1850.</i></p></div>

<p>By the last accounts there was
no less than a million sterling exported
from California in <i>six days</i>.
This amount of gold, great as it is,
however, is by no means the whole of
the supply which has been obtained.
It is the regular measured amount
only&mdash;what entered the custom-house
books, and was exported in the entered
traders. But who can estimate the
amount which in those vast and desolate
regions has been amassed by individuals,
and made its way out of the
country in their private possession, or
secretly in shipments of which no account
was kept? It is incalculable:
like the plunder amassed during the
sack of a capital or province, it may
be guessed at, but cannot be ascertained
with anything approaching to accuracy.
Probably the amount thus
acquired, but not entering any public
records, may equal all that is ascertained
from the custom-house books.
But call it only a half, or fifty per
cent, it will follow that last year the
amount raised was upwards of
&pound;15,000,000, and this year (1851) may
be expected to reach &pound;17,000,000 or
&pound;18,000,000! If so, it will nearly
double the annual supply of the precious
metals for the use of the globe,
which at present, from all sources, is
between &pound;16,000,000 and &pound;17,000,000.
It may with confidence be anticipated,
that how secretly soever great part of
this treasure may be smuggled or conveyed
out of California, none, or at least
very little of it, will be lost. It will
all be carefully preserved, and sooner
or later find its way into the circulation
of the world, or be manufactured
into the gold ornaments and vessels
which minister to its luxury or magnificence.
Nothing more is required
to show the prodigious influence of this
great change; beyond all question it
will, in its ultimate effects, alter the
face of the globe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr M'Culloch observes in his <i>Commercial
Dictionary</i>&mdash;"Should <i>eight or
ten millions</i> yearly, in addition to the
present supply, be obtained from any
other source, it will produce a gradual
alteration of prices, similar to that
which took place three centuries ago
on the discovery of the mines of
Mexico and Peru." No one can
doubt that this observation is well
founded; but if the effect of eight or
ten millions annually added to the
treasures of the world would be so
considerable, what must the effect of
the addition of sixteen or eighteen
millions? Yet this addition is just
<i>now going on</i>. In the month of
August last, the gold shipped at San
Francisco alone was 2,984,000 dollars,
or about &pound;800,000; and supposing
a half more was raised, of which
no account is kept, this is &pound;1,200,000
in a single month! In five weeks
from September 1, the quantity
shipped was 5,000,000 dollars, or
above &pound;1,200,000; which implies at
least &pound;1,800,000 altogether obtained.
This is from the labour of 40,000 or
50,000 persons only, who are at present
engaged in the diggings; but it
is known that from 80,000 to 90,000
will be engaged in them next year,
so that the supply raised may be expected
to be nearly doubled. There
is great inequality in the amount
obtained by individual persons employed
in that laborious occupation;
but taking the average, it is about
four and a half dollars a day. Call it
four only, and suppose they work 250
days in the year, each person at this
rate will raise 1000 dollars' worth of
gold, or nearly &pound;250. At that rate,
50,000 persons would raise &pound;12,500,000
in a year; and 75,000, &pound;18,750,000;&mdash;which
coincides very nearly with the
result derived as above from other
sources of information.</p>

<p>The bullionists, struck with terror
at so prodigious an addition annually
to their darling gold, and consequent
diminution in its exchangeable value,
are beginning to exert themselves to
decry it. They say that there is a
"<i>Currency Restriction Act of Nature</i>;"
that the supply of gold from the alluvial
washings will soon be exhausted;
and that when the excavation comes
to be made from the rocks and mountains
in which the veins are embedded,
it will cease to be profitable, from the
hardness of the strata of rock in which
the veins are found.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The plea in abatement
of the supply of gold thus likely
to be obtained is very remarkable.
The fact of its appearing in the highly
respectable journal where it first was
ushered to the world, and from the
pen of the eminent geologist from
whom it is said to have proceeded, are
alike ominous. It shows at once how
marvellously strong has been the hold
which the mania for raising the value
of gold and cheapening that of everything
else prevailing during the last
thirty years, from the influence of the
holders of realised wealth, has got of
the most influential classes in this
country; and how deep is their alarm
at the prospect of all their measures
being at once blown into the air by
the augmented supply <i>of this very
gold</i> from the shores of California!
A "Currency Restriction Act of Nature!"
What a commentary on the
measures of Sir R. Peel, so vehemently
lauded and strenuously supported by
all the capitalists whose fortunes, from
the Currency Restriction Act of the
right hon. baronet, were every day increasing
in value! They would fain enlist
Nature in the same crusade against
labour and in favour of riches; but
they may save themselves the trouble.
There is no Currency Restriction Act
of Nature: her beneficence, unlike
that of man, is equally distributed
over all her children. The <span class="smcap">Currency
Extension Act</span> of Nature will only
stand forth in brighter relief from having
been immediately preceded by the
Currency <i>Restriction</i> Act of Man.</p>

<p>To show how chimerical are the
hopes of a Currency Restriction Act
of Nature, which is to limit and interrupt
the blessings with which an increased
supply of the precious metals
for the general service of the world
cannot fail to be attended, it is sufficient
to observe that the auriferous
region where the gold is found in alluvial
deposit, is said to be a tract of country
between three and four hundred miles
long and from thirty to forty miles
broad. It is therefore as long as from
London to Berwick, and as broad as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>the average breadth of the plains of
Yorkshire. What is the scraping or
excavations of sixty or eighty thousand
men on so immense a surface?
Conceive every one of these persons
<i>daily digging his own grave</i> in this
auriferous region: how long will it
take them to go over the whole surface
and exhaust its treasures? Only
apply to it the test of the rudest calculation.
A square mile contains
above 3,000,000 square yards. Supposing
each digging occupies two
square yards, there will be 1,500,000
diggings in a square mile; and if each
person excavates a digging a-day,
which is probably as much as can be
calculated upon at an average, as the
operation is so much impeded by
water, 100,000 persons will take
fifteen days to turn up and exhaust
one square mile. In the gold region,
however, there are at least 9000
square miles. Supposing that the
100,000 persons work 300 days in the
year, which is more than can be calculated
upon, they will only turn
over and thoroughly search twenty
square miles in a year. At this rate,
it would take above four hundred
years for even that large army of
labourers to exhaust the <i>alluvial</i> gold
region. We are aware the diggings
do not go on regularly as is now supposed;
that one man tries his fortune
here, and another there; and that the
earth is perforated at the same time
in a great variety of places, many of
them at a considerable distance from
each other. We know, too, that the
real extent of the gold region is hitherto
the object of speculation and hope,
rather than actual survey or knowledge.
It is quite probable, too,
that our calculation, which is a mere
rough guess, may be above the mark
in some particulars, and below it in
others. Still, enough, making allowance
for all such errors, remains to
show that, in the alluvial gold region
alone, if the accounts of its extent
and riches are at all to be relied on,
there is ample room for a vast annual
addition to the treasures of the earth
for a great many generations to come.
The circumstance which makes it all
but certain that the gold region must
be very extensive, is its being found
in the <i>alluvial</i> deposits of the mountain
rivers, such as the Sacramento,
along their whole course. If you find
granite or mica slate particles in the
beds of rivers and the level fields they
overflow near the sea, you are sure
of finding the same deposits up to the
mountain regions from which they
are brought down.</p>

<p>But what is the alluvial gold region
to the mountain region from which the
precious metals with which it abounds
have been torn down by the storms
and wintry torrents of thousands of
years! If you find a <i>detritus</i> of a certain
description in the mixed sand and
gravel of a plain, you may predicate
with perfect certainty the existence of
mountains and rocks of the same formation
in the higher regions from
which it has been brought down.
Granite or mica-slate <i>debris</i> in the
beds of rivers or the level fields which
they occasionally overflow, imply
granite or mica-slate in the hilly region
from which they take their rise.
Whence has all the gold come which
in the alluvial plains of California is
producing such treasures, and changing
prices over the whole world? It
has come down from the mountains.
And what must be the metallic riches
with which they are charged, when the
washed-down gravel at their feet is
so prolific of mineral wealth! The
bullionists, influenced by dread of a
general rise of prices, and depreciation
of the exchangeable value of their
realised fortunes from this rise, say
there is a "Currency Restriction Act
of Nature;" that gold at any depth
is unworkable at a profit; that Providence
is niggardly of its bounty; and
they in secret indulge the hope that
it will continue permanently that contraction
of the currency which they
have contrived to force upon mankind,
and which, while it lasted, has proved
so eminently profitable to themselves.
But a little consideration must show
that their hopes in this respect are
entirely fallacious. Granting that the
veins of gold, when they go deep, are
embedded in very hard rock, what is
to be said to the cropping out of the
veins over the vast extent of the auriferous
Rocky Mountains? If the
wasting away of wintry storms on the
tops and sides of these mountains
brings down such quantities of gold
with the streams which furrow their
sides, must not the laborious hand of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
industry prove equally efficacious in
removing it? If the expansive force
of a rapid thaw, following severe frost,
can rend the rocks in which the gold
is embedded, is not the power of gunpowder
or steam equally great? Already
a company, composed of English
capitalists, has been formed to
explore the mountain treasures; and
without supposing that they are to
find an El Dorado in every hill, and
admitting that there may be several
failures before the right one is hit on,
it is morally certain that in the end
the mountain reserves of treasure must
be discovered.</p>

<p>The additions to the currency of the
earth, hitherto considered, have been
those coming from these auriferous regions
of North America, now for the first
time brought into view only; but this
is by no means the whole of the provision
made by nature for the extended
wants of mankind in this age of transition,
vehement excitement, extended
transactions, and rapidly-increasing
numbers. The <span class="smcap">Ural and Altai
Mountains</span> have brought forth their
treasures at the same time, and provided
as amply for the wants of the
Sclavonic race in the Old, as the Californian
hills have done for the growth
of the Anglo-Saxon in the New World.
Gradually, for twenty years past, the
Russian treasures have been brought
to light; and their progressive increase
has done more to alleviate the distress
and sustain the industry of western
Europe than all the wisdom of man
in her aged monarchies has been
to effect. Grievous as have
been the calamities which the contraction
of the currency of the world
by the reduction of paper in Great
Britain, simultaneously with the ruin
of the South American mines by
the revolutions of its vast regions,
which we laboured so assiduously to
promote, have produced, they would
have been doubly severe if the Ural
and Altai Mountains had not provided
treasures at the very time when the
other supplies were failing, which in
part at least supplied their place.
Their influence was long felt in Europe
before their amount was suspected,
and even now the wisdom or terrors
of the Russian Government have prevented
it from being accurately known;
but it is generally understood to have
now reached five or six millions sterling
annually; and, like the Californian
gold, it is susceptible of an indefinite
increase, in the event of the influx
of that metal from America not
lowering its value so as to render it
unworkable in Asia at a profit.</p>

<p>Assuming it, then, as certain that
for a very long period, and for many
successive generations, a vast addition
is to be made to the annual
supply of the metallic treasures of the
earth, it becomes of the highest importance
to the interests of industry
in all its branches, agricultural, commercial,
and manufacturing, to consider
what <i>the effects of the change</i>
thus induced must be&mdash;what benefits
it will confer upon mankind&mdash;what
dangers, if any, it will remove, especially
in the great commercial community
in which we are placed. And a
little consideration must be sufficient
to demonstrate to every impartial and
disinterested mind what these effects
will be&mdash;and to prevent, on the one
hand, chimerical or unfounded hopes
being formed, and, on the other, undue
or unmanly depression from the
effects of recent calamities being felt.
Fortunately we are not driven to
theory or speculation to ascertain what
these effects will be&mdash;experience, the
only sure guide in political science,
points to them with unerring certainty:
the great monetary revolution of the
sixteenth century is the precursor and
the monitor of that of the nineteenth.</p>

<p>The first effect of a great addition
being made to the annual supply of a
particular metal in general use and
high estimation all over the world, is
that the exchangeable value of <i>that
metal</i>, in comparison with other metals
or articles of consumption, will undergo
an immediate alteration, which will
prove lasting and considerable if the
increased supply turns out to be great
and permanent. This is no more than
takes place every day with all the
articles of commerce. According as
the crop of wheat, or oats, or barley,
or cotton proves abundant, so surely
does the price of these articles rise or
fall in the market. If gold is produced
in much greater quantities than heretofore,
its price, as compared with
everything else, and in particular with
the precious metal in common use,
next to it in value, silver, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
ere long change. If the increased
supply proves very great, it may in
time come to reduce the price of gold,
as compared with silver, fifty, eighty,
or even a hundred per cent. Gold
is more valuable than silver, only because
it is more scarce: if it becomes
equally plentiful, its value will
gradually sink; and if the quantity
afloat in the earth should ever come
to be as great as that of silver, it
would come to be of no greater value.
This effect may appear either in the
fall of the value of gold as compared
with silver, or notes exchangeable
into gold, or in the <i>rise</i> in the value
of silver as compared with that of
gold, or notes exchangeable into that
metal. This effect has already taken
place. Silver is 3 per cent dearer as
compared with gold than it was a year
ago: and this change will doubtless
continue. This is the first and obvious
effect of a great addition to the
gold treasures of the earth; and even
this is a considerable benefit; because,
as it has been produced by the augmentation
of the amount of the circulating
medium of mankind, it must
facilitate the acquisition of it for the
purposes of commerce, or for sustaining
the undertakings of industry.</p>

<p>But though this is the first, it is by
no means either the only or the most
important effect of a great addition
to the gold treasures of the earth. By
far the most important and beneficial
effect is to be found in <i>the gradual but
certain rise of prices</i>, whether measured
in gold, silver, or paper, which inevitably
results from any considerable
addition to the circulating medium of
mankind. This effect is precisely analogous
to the great rise of prices which
took place during the war, in consequence
of the extended issue of paper
which was made after 1797 to sustain
its expenses. It is well known that it
more than doubled the cost of every
article of consumption: it raised the
price of wheat, in fifteen years, from
55s. to 110s.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This effect resulted from
the extension of the issues of the Bank
of England from twelve to twenty-eight
millions a-year. A result precisely
the same must take place over
the whole world from a lasting and
considerable addition to the metallic
treasures by which its exchanges are
conducted. If the gold in circulation,
or which may be put into circulation,
is greatly augmented, the price of
everything must rise, whether it is
paid in <i>gold or silver</i>, just as the price
of everything rose during the war,
whether paid in specie or in paper.
Gold then bore such a monopoly price,
from its being so much in request for
the necessities of war, that the guinea
at last came to be worth twenty-eight
shillings. That was the enhanced
price of gold, as compared with silver;
it had risen thirty per cent in consequence
of the absorption of gold specie
in the Peninsular, German, and Russian
campaigns. But the change of
prices resulting from the extended
issue of paper was much more considerable;
it had increased not thirty,
but a hundred per cent, and that
equally, whether the price was paid in
gold, silver, paper, or copper.</p>

<p>This change will be universal. It
is a mistake to suppose that it will be
limited to the countries, such as England,
in which gold is the established
standard of value. It will affect
equally, certainly, though perhaps
somewhat more indirectly, the nations,
such as France, where silver is the
standard and great medium of exchange.
The reason is, that by adding
considerably to the general circulating
medium of the globe, it brings
a larger quantity to be balanced against
every article which forms the subject
of commerce, and consequently raises
its price when measured by any part
of that circulating medium. This
effect may be seen every day in ordinary
life. A plentiful crop of wheat,
especially if it continues for several
years in succession, lowers the price
not only of wheat, <i>but of every other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
grain crop in the country</i>, and consequently
raises the price of every
article of commerce when measured
by the amount given for it in any of
these grain crops. And the same effect
took place on a great scale, over
the whole world, for centuries together,
when the mines of Mexico and
Peru were discovered, which, although
chiefly productive of silver only, yet,
by the large quantity of that metal
which they yielded, raised prices to a
very great degree universally, and that
equally whether those prices were
paid in gold, silver, or copper.</p>

<p>The effects hitherto considered are
those on the value of the precious
metals themselves from a considerable
and continued increase in their supply
in any part of the world. But in a
commercial and opulent community
such as Great Britain, where the greater
part of its undertakings are carried
on by means of money advanced by
banks in their own notes or those
of the Bank of England, on the security
of bills or other obligations, the
effect of a considerable increase in the
supply of gold or silver is far more
extensive. Such an increase diminishes
the great weakness of a paper
circulation, that of being dependent
on the supply of the precious metals,
and liable to be contracted when they
are withdrawn. An inconvertible
paper, issued in reasonable and not
excessive quantities, and adequately
guaranteed, would answer the purpose
just as well in a particular country,
and effectually secure it against
the terrible disasters consequent on
the alternate expansion and contraction
of the currency; the former inducing
the commencement of undertakings
of which the latter disabled the
performance. But the world is not wise
enough yet to perceive how easy and
effectual a remedy this simple expedient
would provide against the greatest
and most extensive calamities
which now afflict humanity; and so
great is the power of vested capital
which such calamities benefit, that it
is probable several generations must
descend to their graves, or become insolvent,
before it is generally adopted.
But the extension of the metallic currency
of the globe, though it cannot altogether
remove, materially lessens this
dreadful danger. <i>It inspires confidence
among moneyed men.</i> It diminishes the
terror of the withdrawal of the precious
metals, which, when it once
seizes them, is productive of such unbounded
calamities; and thus renders
the granting of accommodation on
their part both more abundant and
more regular. Paper becomes more
plentiful, because gold, on which it is
based, has flowed into the coffers of
the banks in larger quantities, and
thus at once augmented their own
treasures, and diminished the risk of
their being drained away by the necessities
of other men. The effect of
this change in a commercial and
manufacturing community is incalculable.
We can form a clear idea
from woeful experience, of what it is.
It is precisely the converse of Sir R.
Peel's measure.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give a better
picture of what this great Currency
Extension Act of Nature will do for industry
in all countries, and especially
the commercial, than by saying that
it will as nearly as possible <i>reverse</i>
the effects which Mr Cobden, the
great advocate for the cheapening
system, said, in his evidence before the
Committee on Bank Issues in 1840,
he had experienced in the preceding
years in his own business from the
contraction of the currency consequent
on the great importation of
grain in 1838 and 1839:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I could adduce a fact derived from
my own experience that would illustrate
the heavy losses to which manufacturers
were exposed in their operations, by those
fluctuations (in 1837) in the value of
money. I am a calico printer. I purchase
the cloth, which is my raw material, in
the market; and have usually in warehouse
three or four months' supply of
material. I must necessarily proceed in
my operations, whatever change there
may be&mdash;whether a rise or a fall in the
market. I employ six hundred hands;
and those hands must be employed. I
have fixed machinery and capital which
<i>must</i> also be kept going; and, therefore,
whatever the prospects of a rise or fall in
price may be, I am constantly obliged to
be purchasing the material, and contracting
for the material on which I operate.
In 1837 I lost by my stock in hand
L.20,000, as compared with the stock-taking
in 1835, 1836, and 1838; the average
of those three years, when compared
with 1837, shows that I lost L.20,000 by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
my business in 1837; and what I wish to
add is, that the whole of this loss arose
from the depreciation in the value of my
stock.</p>

<p>"My business was as prosperous; we
stood as high as printers as we did previously;
our business since that has been
as good, and there was no other cause for
the losses I then sustained, but the depreciation
of the value of the articles in
warehouse in my hands. What I wish
particularly to show, is the defenceless
condition in which we manufacturers are
placed, and how completely we are at the
mercy of these unnatural fluctuations.
Although I was aware that the losses
were coming, it was impossible I could
do otherwise than proceed onward&mdash;with
the certainty of suffering a loss on the
stock; to stop the work of six hundred
hands, and to fail to supply our customers,
would have been altogether ruinous; that
is a fact drawn from my own experience.
I wish to point to another example of
a most striking kind, showing the effect
of these fluctuations on merchants. I
hold in my hand a list of thirty-six articles
which were imported in 1837, by
the house of Butterworth and Brookes of
Manchester, a house very well known;
Mr Brookes is now borough-reeve of Manchester.
Here is a list of thirty-six
articles imported in the year 1837, in the
regular way of business, and opposite to
each article there is the rate of loss upon
it as it arrived, and as it was sold. The
average loss is 37&frac12; per cent on those
thirty-six articles, and they were imported
from Canton, Trieste, Bombay, Bahia,
Alexandria, Lima, and, in fact, all the intermediate
places almost. This, I presume,
is a fair guide to show the losses
which other merchants incurred on similar
articles."</p></div>

<p>It was these disastrous losses which
made Mr Cobden a Free-trader. He
wished to cheapen everything as his
own produce had been cheapened.
The contraction of the currency, and
its being made dependent on the retention
of gold, was the origin and
root of the whole evil and all the
disasters the nation has since undergone.</p>

<p>Such a change, however, the reverse
of all this, like all those produced by
nature, is so gradual as to the vast
majority of men to be imperceptible.
Like the gradual extension of the day
in spring, or the change of temperature,
the change is so slight from day to day
that it eludes even the closest observation.
From one month to another,
however, the alteration is great and
striking. The addition, first, of six or
eight millions of gold, annually raised,
rising by degrees to sixteen or eighteen
millions&mdash;which doubles the annual
supply of the precious metals for
the use of the globe&mdash;being diffused
over an immense surface, and finding
its way more or less into the coffers
of all nations, may not produce a
great or even visible start of prices at
any one time. But the change will
be incessant; and before many years
have elapsed, the result, if the increased
supply continues, will be
great and apparent. In the first instance,
the effect will appear in arresting
the fall of prices which has so
long been going on, and which our
legislative measures have all been
calculated to increase. But after
arresting the fall, it will speedily
induce a rise; and this rise will for a
long period be so steady and considerable
as to produce a very great
increase in the remuneration of the
labouring classes, and immensely to
benefit them. There is no speculation
in this: it is only supposing that the
increase of gold is to produce the
same effect as the increase of silver,
from the discovery of the South American
mines, did three centuries ago.</p>

<p>The effect of the same change, by
diminishing the weight of debt and
taxes, will be still more signal and
beneficial. Among the many and
appalling evils of which a rise in the
value of the circulating medium, and
consequent fall in that of everything
else, is productive, there is perhaps
none so widespread and calamitous in
its effects, as the adding to the weight
of debts and taxes, and thus weighing
down the energies of the productive
classes, upon whose efforts the whole
prosperity of society depends. It is
that which has been the great cause
of the long-continued depression and
agony, interrupted only by fleeting
gleams of prosperity, of the last thirty
years, as the sudden expansion and
contraction of the currency consequent
on its being made dependent
on the presence or absence of the
precious metals, has been of its
frightful oscillations. The taxes now
paid by the nation, as measured by
the price of wheat&mdash;the true measure&mdash;are,
after, five-and-thirty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of peace, twice as heavy as they were
in 1815, after twenty years of a costly
war. This is what renders it so difficult
for any government to maintain
armaments, either at sea or land, at all
commensurate to the public necessities;
which has weakened our national
influence, and degraded our national
character, and exposed us to the deplorable
state of weakness against
foreign aggression, to the dangers of
which, the Duke of Wellington has
said he has found it impossible to
awaken any Administration for thirty
years. The Government see the public
dangers, but they are disabled from
guarding against them, because Parliament,
stimulated by suffering constituencies
whom the fall of prices
has involved in constant difficulties,
will not vote the necessary supplies.
It is the same with the weight
of mortgages, jointures, family provisions,
bonds, bills, and debts of
every description. They have all
been doubled in weight since the bill
of 1819 contracted the currency; and
hence the inextricable embarrassments
into which nearly all classes of the
community have been precipitated,
except the moneyed, whose fortunes
have every day been increasing in
real amount, from the same cause
which has spread ruin so generally
around them.</p>

<p>When it is said that the effect of
Californian gold will be to reverse all
this&mdash;to reduce gradually, and probably
before twenty years have elapsed,
<i>half the weight of debt and taxes</i> now
felt as so grievous a burden by the
community&mdash;it is affirmed that it will
confer, perhaps, the greatest blessing
which a beneficent Providence
could confer on a suffering world. In
England it will gradually and to
a certain extent, so far as average
prices are concerned, undo all that
the Bullionists and Free-traders have
been doing for the last thirty years.
It will remove a large part of the
frightful evils consequent on the monetary
measures of Sir Robert Peel;
and if seconded by a revision of our
import duties, and a moderate tax for
fiscal purposes on all foreign articles
brought into the country, it would go
far to repair the devastation produced
by the selfish legislation of the last
thirty years. In France it will arrest
that dreadful fall of wages which, ever
since the peace, has been felt to be
increasing, from the constant reduction
of prices arising from the destruction
of the South American mines, and
the simultaneous measures adopted
for the contraction of the currency in
Great Britain. The unjust monopoly
of realised capital will be arrested,
at least for a long period. The unjust
depression of industry, by the continued
fall of prices, will be gradually
terminated. But so gradual will be
the change, and so unseen the operation
of the vivifying element thus let
into society, that even the classes
most benefited by it will, for the most
part, be ignorant of the cause to
which their improved circumstances
have been owing. They will be
blessed by the hand of Nature, they
know not how or by whom, as, under
the former system, they were cursed
by the hand of man, they knew not
how or by whom.</p>

<p>Already the beneficial effects of
Californian gold have been felt over
the whole world, and nowhere more
strongly than in this country. It is
well known that prices of all articles
of commerce, except corn and sugar,
have risen twenty or thirty per cent
within the last year; and the Free-traders
consider that as being entirely
owing to their measures. If so, it is
singular how <i>corn and sugar</i>, on which
the inundation of Free Trade has
been chiefly let in since 1846, should
be the <i>only exceptions</i> to the general
rise. It is singular what contradictory
effects they ascribe to their system:
at one time it is lauded to the
skies, because it tends to lower
prices, and cheapen every article of
consumption; at another, because it
is said to raise prices, and encourage
every branch of industry. Both
effects cannot be owing to the same
system: to ascribe them both to it
is to say that a certain combination
of gases produces alternately fire and
water. At all events, if Free Trade
brings about a rise of prices, what
comes of all the arguments which
went to recommend it on the score of
reducing them? The truth is, however,
Free Trade has nothing whatever
to do with the recent rise of
prices of manufactured articles, nor
with the extension of the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
exports which has taken place. These
happy results, the passing gleam of
sunshine, have been entirely owing to
other causes, among which Californian
gold bears a prominent place. Free
Trade has tended only to continue
and perpetuate the misery and depression
which attended its first introduction.</p>

<p>This argument of the increase of
our exports last year (1850) having
been owing to Free Trade, has been so
admirably disposed of by that able
and intrepid man to whom the nation
is under such obligations for the light
he has thrown on these subjects, and
the courageous way in which he has
everywhere asserted them, in a late
public meeting at Rugby, that we
cannot do better than quote his
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Free-traders had boasted much
of their system as having increased the
amount of our exports; and he (Mr
Young) had been continually trying for
a long period to get from them the names
of the countries to which those increased
imports went. At length he had the
fact; and the result would be most startling
as applied to the arguments and predictions
of that party before the corn law
was repealed. The countries he would
take were Russia, Sweden, Norway,
Denmark, Prussia, Germany, Holland,
Belgium, and France; and he found that
in the year 1845 the quantity of corn imported
from all these countries, comprising,
as they did, the whole of northern
and central Europe, amounted to 1,741,730
quarters, whilst the declared value of
British and Irish manufactures exported
to those countries was L.17,504,417. But
last year the corn imported from those
countries had increased in quantity to
6,857,530 quarters, whilst our exports to
them had decreased to L.15,274,639.
These figures showed that from the whole
of northern and central Europe we took
last year no less than 5,115,800 quarters
of corn more than in 1845, and that there
was a decrease in the value of our exports
of L.2,229,778. Again, last year
the declared value of our <i>gross</i> exports
amounted to L.63,596,025, but in 1845 it
reached the sum of L.60,111,082; so
that in the course of these four years the
increase was only L.3,484,943. He
found also that our exports in 1830 were
L.35,842,623, and in 1835, L.47,372,270,
being an increase on the five years of
L.11,529,647, or 32 2-10ths per cent.
That was an increase under the operation
of protection. In 1840 the exports
amounted to L.51,406,430, or an
increase upon 1835 of L.4,634,160, or 8
5-10ths per cent. In 1845 they were
L.60,111,082&mdash;an increase on 1840 of
L.8,704,652, or 16 9-10ths per cent. In
1849, L.63,596,025, an increase on 1845
of L.3,484,943; and in the present year,
supposing the increase continued in the
same ratio, he calculated that that increase
would on the year 1845 be about
L.4,350,000, or 7 2-10ths per cent.
Would Free-traders boast of their exports
after that? They talked upon
this question as if the country had, under
the system of protection, been in a perfectly
dead and stagnant condition, and
that the agriculturists were like the clods
of the earth, and less capable of improvement.
Why, it was under protection
that our ships were employed to go to
the island of Ichaboe, from which guano
was first imported into this country; and
it was under protection that that island
had disappeared from the face of the
ocean, and every cwt. of its guano had
been brought here and spread upon the
soil. He rejoiced and exulted in the
march of science as much as any man;
but it was an arrogant and an unfounded
assumption on the part of the Free-traders
to monopolise to themselves, as the result
of their system, those improvements in
agriculture which were going on under
protection with railroad speed, and to
which, in truth, their measures had only
given a check, and not an impetus.
But then he was asked, what have you to
say to the United States? He would
tell them. He found that the exports
to the United States amounted to
L.11,971,028 in 1849; but in 1836 they
were not less than L.12,425,605; so that
the exports in the former exceeded those
in the latter year by L.454,577. Surely
facts like these would dispose of a few of
the Free-trade fallacies, and we should
not hear them again repeated, at all
events."&mdash;<i>Morning Herald</i>, Nov. 28,
1850.</p></div>

<p>The restoration of peace on the Continent
was the principal cause which
again raised the amount of our exports
to the Old World. This appears decisively
in the returns: the exports
of Great Britain to Germany alone,
which, in 1848, had sunk to less
than &pound;4,000,000, rose, in 1850, to
&pound;6,078,355. The cessation of purchases
to the Continent, during the
two preceding years, in consequence
of the alarm consequent on the French
and German revolutions, only made
the rush for English manufactures
greater when the restoration of tranquillity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
reopened the Continent to our
industry. In America the change
was equally great, and equally irrespective
of Free Trade: our exports to
the United States, in 1850, exceeded
&pound;12,000,000. This extension arose
from the general rise of prices, and extension
of credit, from the opening of
the treasures of California. It not only
created a new market for exports on
the reverse of the Rocky Mountains,
but so vivified and animated every
part of the Union, as rendered them
capable of purchasing a much larger
quantity of the manufactured articles
of this country than they had done
for a great number of years.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>But by far the most important and
beneficial effect of Californian gold
hitherto experienced has been in the
extension of credit and increase of
accommodation at home. This effect
is obvious and important. The notes
of the Bank of England in circulation,
have risen in the last year to
L.20,000,000 or L.21,000,000 from
L.16,500,000, which they had fallen
to during the panic. The circulation
of every other bank has, as a matter
of course, been proportionably augmented.
What produced this great
increase in the circulating medium?
The influx of bullion into the country,
which augmented the treasure in
the Bank of England to above
L.16,000,000. There is the secret of
the whole thing; of the activity in
the manufacturing districts, and the
general extension of credit and rise
of prices through the districts.
It is Californian gold which has
done the whole; for it has at once
filled to overflowing the vaults of
the Bank of England, and relieved its
officers, and those of all similar establishments,
from all dread of a drain of
specie setting in. Gold was abundant;
the banks no longer feared a
collapse: therefore notes were abundant
also; the terrors of the holders
of them were abated. Prices rose,
and credit was extended. We are
far from thinking that it is a wise
and judicious system to make credit
of every kind entirely dependent
on the amount of metallic treasure
in the vaults of the Bank of
England: we only say, having done
this by Sir R. Peel's monetary system,
we have to thank California for
having put at least <i>a temporary stop
to the evils with which it was pregnant</i>.
It is not surprising that the
addition of even so small a sum to
the metallic circulation of the commercial
world should produce, in a
single year, so great a result. The discovery
of two millions of bank-notes,
in an old chest of the Bank of England,
stopped the panic of December 1825;
the mere issuing of Lord J. Russell's
letter, announcing the temporary repeal
of the Bank Charter Act, put a
period to the far severer crash of 1847.
The addition of five millions to the
metallic treasure of this country is
quite sufficient to vivify every
branch of industry, for it will probably
put fifty millions, in bank-notes
and private bills, into circulation.</p>

<p>As the influx of Californian gold,
however, is an element of such immense
importance thus let into the
social world, it is material to observe
what evils it is adequate to remedy,
and to what social diseases it can be
regarded as a panacea. This is the
more necessary, because, while it
tends by its beneficent influence to
conceal for a time the pernicious
effects of other measures, it is by no
means a remedy for them; nor has it
a tendency even, in the long run, to
lessen their danger. It induces immediate
prosperity, by the extension
of credit and rise of prices with which
it is attended; but it has no tendency
to diminish the dreadful evils of Free-Trade
and a currency mainly dependent
on the retention of the precious
metals at all times in the country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>On the contrary, it may, under many
circumstances, materially aggravate
them.</p>

<p>As the effect produced by a great
addition of the metallic treasures of
the earth is <i>universal</i>, it must affect
prices equally in every part of the
world. The largest part of the bullion,
indeed, will be brought to the
richest country, which is best able to
buy it, and has most need of it to
form the basis of its transactions.
But still, some part will find its way
into every country; prices will be
everywhere raised, and <i>the relative
proportion between them in different
countries will remain the same, or even
be rendered more unfavourable to
the richer state</i>. That is the material
circumstance; for it shows
that it must leave the greatest and
most lasting evils of Free Trade
untouched. Supposing gold to become
so plentiful that the sovereign
is only worth ten shillings, and the
effect on general prices to be such
that the average price of the quarter
of wheat is raised from forty to sixty
shillings&mdash;which, in a course of years,
is by no means improbable&mdash;still the
relative position of the British with
the Polish and American cultivator
will remain the same. The price of
the wheat may be raised from 15s.
to 25s. a-quarter, on the banks of the
Vistula or the Mississippi; but still
the <i>ability of their cultivators to
undersell our farmers will remain
the same</i>, or rather be augmented.
Prices will still be so much higher in
the old rich and heavily-taxed country,
which absorbs the largest part
of the metallic circulation of the earth,
than in the young poor and untaxed
one, that in the production of the
fruits of the earth, to which machinery
can never be made applicable, the
inability to carry on the competition
will only be rendered the more apparent
by the increasing, or at all
events, permanent difference of the
prices.</p>

<p>In the next place, how cheap soever
gold, from its augmented plenty, may
become, there will be no cessation, as
long as our paper circulation remains
on its present footing, of those dreadful
monetary crises which now, at
stated periods recurring every five or
six years, spread such unheard-of
ruin through the industrious classes.
Let gold, from its greater plenty,
become of only half its value, or a
sovereign be only worth ten shillings,
and prices, in consequence, rise to
double their present amount, the danger
of a monetary crisis, as long as
our currency is based on its present
footing, will remain the same. Still,
any considerable drain of the metallic
treasure of the country, such as
it is&mdash;either from the necessities of
foreign war, the adverse state of
foreign exchanges, or a great importation,
occasioned by a deficient
home harvest&mdash;will send the specie
headlong out, and, by suddenly contracting
the currency, ruin half of the
persons engaged in business undertakings.
It is the <i>inconceivable folly</i> of
making the paper circulation dependent
on the retention of the metallic;
the enormous error of enacting, that,
for every five sovereigns that are
drawn out of the country, a five-pound
note shall be drawn in by the
bankers; the infatuated self-immolation
arising from the gratuitous negation
of the greatest blessing of a
paper circulation&mdash;that of supplying,
during the temporary absence of the
metallic currency, its want, and obviating
all the evils thence arising&mdash;which
is the real source of the evils
under which we have suffered so
severely since the disastrous epoch of
1819, when the system was introduced.
The increased supply of gold,
so far from tending to obviate this
danger, has a directly opposite effect;
for, by augmenting the metallic treasures
of the country, and thus raising
credit during periods of prosperity, it
engages the nation in a vast variety
of undertakings, the completion of
which is rendered impossible when
the wind of adversity blows, by the
sudden contraction of its currency
and credit. And to this danger <i>the
mercantile classes are exposed beyond
any other</i>; for as their undertakings
are always far beyond their realised
capital, and supported entirely by
credit, every periodical contraction of
the currency, recurring every five or
six years, exposes one-half of them
to inevitable ruin.</p>

<p>Let not the Free-traders, therefore,
lay the flattering unction to their
souls, that California is to get them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
out of all their difficulties, and that
after having, by their ruinous measures,
brought the nation to the very
brink of ruin, and destroyed one-half
of its wealth engaged in commerce,
they are to escape the deserved execration
of ages, by the effects of an
accidental discovery of metallic treasures
on the shores of the Pacific.
Californian gold, a gift of Providence
to a suffering world, will arrest the
general and calamitous fall of prices
which the Free-traders have laboured
so assiduously to introduce, and thus
diminish in a most material degree
the weight of debts and taxes. So far
it will undoubtedly tend to relieve the
industrious classes, <i>especially in the
rural districts</i>, from much of the misery
induced on them by their oppressors;
but it cannot work impossibilities.
It will leave industry in all
classes, and in none more than the
manufacturing, exposed to the ruinous
competition of foreigners, working,
whatever the value of money may be,
at a cheaper rate than we can ever do,
because in poorer and comparatively
untaxed countries. It will leave the
commercial classes permanently exposed
to the periodical recurrence of
monetary storms, arising out of the
very plenty of the currency when
credit is high, and its sudden withdrawal
from the effect of adverse
exchanges, or the drain consequent
on vast importations of food. It will
leave the British navy, and with it
the British colonial empire and our
national independence, gradually sinking
from the competition, in shipping,
of poorer states. Nature will do much
to counteract the disasters induced
by human folly; but the punishment
of guilty selfishness is as much a part
of her system as the relief of innocent
suffering; and to the end of the world
those who seek to enrich themselves
by the ruin of their neighbours will
work out, in the very success of their
measures, their own deserved and
memorable punishment.</p>

probable that these bills were actually a <i>paper currency</i>, and that they circulated as

<p class="center">BY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.</p>


<h3>BOOK III.&mdash;INITIAL CHAPTER, SHOWING HOW MY NOVEL CAME TO BE CALLED "MY NOVEL."</h3>

<p>"I am not displeased with your
novel, so far as it has gone," said my
father graciously; "though as for The
Sermon&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I trembled; but the ladies,
Heaven bless them! had taken Parson
Dale under their special protection;
and, observing that my father
was puckering up his brows critically,
they rushed boldly forward in defence
of The Sermon, and Mr Caxton was
forced to beat a retreat. However,
like a skilful general, he renewed the
assault upon outposts less gallantly
guarded. But as it is not my business
to betray my weak points, I leave it to
the ingenuity of cavillers to discover
the places at which the Author of
<i>Human Error</i> directed his great guns.</p>

<p>"But," said the Captain, "you are
a lad of too much spirit, Pisistratus,
to keep us always in the obscure
country quarters of Hazeldean&mdash;you
will march us out into open service
before you have done with us?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, magisterially, for he
has been somewhat nettled by Mr
Caxton's remarks&mdash;and he puts on an
air of dignity, in order to awe away
minor assailants.&mdash;"Yes, Captain
Roland&mdash;not yet awhile, but all in
good time. I have not stinted myself
in canvass, and behind my
foreground of the Hall and the Parsonage
I propose, hereafter, to open
some lengthened perspective of the
varieties of English life&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"Hum!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>, putting her hand on my
father's lip.&mdash;"We shall know better
the design, perhaps, when we know
the title. Pray, Mr Author, what is
the title?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Mother</span>, with more animation
than usual.&mdash;"Ay, Sisty&mdash;the title?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, startled.&mdash;"The
title! By the soul of Cervantes! I
have never yet thought of a title!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Roland</span>, solemnly.&mdash;"There
is a great deal in a good title.
As a novel reader, I know that by
experience."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Squills.</span>&mdash;"Certainly; there is
not a catchpenny in the world but
what goes down, if the title be apt
and seductive. Witness 'Old Parr's
Life Pills.' Sell by the thousand, sir,
when my 'Pills for Weak Stomachs,'
which I believe to be just the same
compound, never paid for the advertising."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"Parr's Life Pills!
a fine stroke of genius! It is not
every one who has a weak stomach,
or time to attend to it, if he have.
But who would not swallow a pill to
live to a hundred and fifty-two?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, stirring the fire in
great excitement.&mdash;"My title! my
title!&mdash;what shall be my title!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>, thrusting his hand
into his waistcoat, and in his most
didactic of tones.&mdash;"From a remote
period, the choice of a title has perplexed
the scribbling portion of mankind.
We may guess how their invention
has been racked by the strange
contortions it has produced. To begin
with the Hebrews. 'The Lips of the
Sleeping,' (<i>Labia Dormientium</i>)&mdash;what
book do you suppose that title to designate?&mdash;A
Catalogue of Rabbinical
writers! Again, imagine some young
lady of old captivated by the sentimental
title of 'The Pomegranate
with its Flower,' and opening on a
treatise on the Jewish Ceremonials!
Let us turn to the Romans. Aulus
Gellius commences his pleasant gossiping
'Noctes' with a list of the
titles in fashion in his day. For
instance, '<i>The Muses</i>' and '<i>The Veil</i>,'
'<i>The Cornucopia</i>,' '<i>The Beehive</i>,' and
'<i>The Meadow</i>.' Some titles, indeed,
were more truculent, and promised
food to those who love to sup upon
horrors&mdash;such as '<i>The Torch</i>,' '<i>The
Poniard</i>,' '<i>The Stiletto</i>'&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, impatiently.&mdash;"Yes,
sir; but to come to My Novel."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>, unheeding the interruption.&mdash;"You
see, you have a fine
choice here, and of a nature pleasing,
and not unfamiliar to a classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
reader; or you may borrow a hint
from the early Dramatic Writers."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, more hopefully.&mdash;"Ay!
there is something in the Drama
akin to the Novel. Now, perhaps, I
may catch an idea."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"For instance,
the author of the <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>
(from whom, by the way, I
am plagiarising much of the information
I bestow upon you) tells us of a
Spanish gentleman who wrote a Comedy,
by which he intended to serve
what he took for Moral Philosophy."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, eagerly.&mdash;"Well, sir?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"And called it 'The
Pain of the Sleep of the World.'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;"Very comic indeed,
sir."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"Grave things were
then called Comedies, as old things
are now called Novels. Then there
are all the titles of early Romance
itself at your disposal&mdash;'Theagenes
and Chariclea,' or 'The Ass' of
Longus, or 'The Golden Ass' of
Apuleius, or the titles of Gothic Romance,
such as 'The most elegant, delicious,
mellifluous, and delightful
History of Perceforest, King of Great
Britain,'"&mdash;And therewith my father
ran over a list of names as long as the
Directory, and about as amusing.</p>

<p>"Well, to my taste," said my
mother, "the novels I used to read
when a girl, (for I have not read many
since, I am ashamed to say,)&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"No, you need not
be at all ashamed of it, Kitty."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Mother</span>, proceeding.&mdash;"Were
much more inviting than any you
mention, Austin."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Captain.</span>&mdash;"True."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Squills.</span>&mdash;"Certainly. Nothing
like them now-a-days!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Mother.</span>&mdash;"'<i>Says she to her
Neighbour, What?</i>'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Captain.</span>&mdash;"'<i>The Unknown,
or the Northern Gallery</i>'&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Squills.</span>&mdash;"'<i>There is a Secret;
Find it Out!</i>'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, pushed to the verge
of human endurance, and upsetting
tongs, poker, and fire-shovel.&mdash;"What
nonsense you are talking, all of you!
For heaven's sake, consider what
an important matter we are called
upon to decide. It is not now the
titles of those very respectable works
which issued from the Minerva Press
that I ask you to remember&mdash;it is to
invent a title for mine&mdash;My Novel!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>, clapping his hands
gently.&mdash;"Excellent&mdash;capital! Nothing
can be better; simple, natural,
pertinent, concise&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;"What is it, sir&mdash;what
is it! Have you really thought
of a title to My Novel?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>.&mdash;"You have hit it
yourself&mdash;'My Novel.' It is your
Novel&mdash;people will know it is your
Novel. Turn and twist the English
language as you will&mdash;be as allegorical
as Hebrew, Greek, Roman&mdash;Fabulist
or Puritan&mdash;still, after all, it is your
Novel, and nothing more nor less
than your Novel."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, thoughtfully, and
sounding the words various ways.&mdash;"'My
Novel'&mdash;um&mdash;um! 'My Novel!'
rather bald&mdash;and curt, eh?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>.&mdash;"Add what you say
you intend it to depict&mdash;Varieties in
English Life."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Mother.</span>&mdash;"'<i>My Novel; or,
Varieties in English Life</i>'&mdash;I don't
think it sounds amiss. What say
you, Roland? Would it attract you
in a catalogue?"</p>

<p>My Uncle hesitates, when Mr
Caxton exclaims imperiously&mdash;</p>

<p>"The thing is settled! Don't disturb
Camarina."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squills.</span>&mdash;"If it be not too great
a liberty, pray who or what is Camarina?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton.</span>&mdash;"Camarina, Mr
Squills, was a lake, apt to be low, and
then liable to be muddy; and 'Don't
disturb Camarina' was a Greek proverb
derived from an Oracle of Apollo;
and from that Greek proverb, no
doubt, comes the origin of the injunction,
'<i>Quieta non movere</i>,' which
became the favourite maxim of Sir
Robert Walpole and Parson Dale.
The Greek line, Mr Squills, (here my
father's memory began to warm,) is
preserved by <span class="smcap">Stephanus Byzantinus</span>,
de <i>Urbibus</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Parson Dale, as a clergyman and a
scholar, had, no doubt, these authorities
at his fingers' end. And I wonder
he did not quote them," quoth my
father; "but, to be sure, he is represented
as a mild man, and so might
not wish to humble the Squire over
much in the presence of his family.
Meanwhile, My Novel is My Novel;
and now that that matter is settled,

may be picked up, the children may go
to bed, Blanche and Kitty may speculate
apart upon the future dignities of the
Neogilos, taking care, nevertheless, to
finish the new pinbefores he requires
for the present; Roland may cast up
his account-book, Mr Squills have his
brandy and water, and all the world
be comfortable, each in his own way.
Blanche, come away from the screen,
get me my slippers, and leave Pisistratus

disturb Camarina. You see,
my dear," added my father kindly,
as, after settling himself into his slippers,
he detained Blanche's hand in
his own&mdash;"you see, my dear, every
house has its Camarina. Man, who
is a lazy animal, is quite content to

more active, bustling, curious creature,
is always for giving it a sly stir."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>, with female dignity.&mdash;"I
assure you, that if Pisistratus had not
called me, I should not have&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>, interrupting her,
without lifting his eyes from the book
he has already taken.&mdash;"Certainly
you would not. I am now in the
midst of the great Puseyite Controversy.

Camarina."</p>

<p>A dead silence for half an hour,
at the end of which</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, from behind the
screen.&mdash;"Blanche, my dear, I want
to consult you."</p>

<p>Blanche does not stir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;"Blanche, I say."</p>

<p>Blanche glances in triumph towards
Mr Caxton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Caxton</span>, laying down his theological
tract, and rubbing his spectacles
mournfully.&mdash;"I hear him,
child; I hear him. I retract my vindication
of Man. Oracles warn in vain:
so long as there is a woman on the
other side of the screen,&mdash;it is all up
with Camarina!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>It is greatly to be regretted that
Mr Stirn was not present at the
Parson's Discourse&mdash;but that valuable
functionary was far otherwise
engaged&mdash;indeed, during the summer
months he was rarely seen at the
afternoon service. Not that he cared
for being preached at&mdash;not he: Mr
Stirn would have snapped his finger
at the thunders of the Vatican. But
the fact was, that Mr Stirn chose to
do a great deal of gratuitous business
upon the day of rest. The
Squire allowed all persons, who
chose, to walk about the park on a
Sunday; and many came from a distance
to stroll by the lake, or recline
under the elms. These visitors were
objects of great suspicion, nay, of
positive annoyance, to Mr Stirn&mdash;and,
indeed, not altogether without
reason, for we English have a natural
love of liberty, which we are even
more apt to display in the grounds of
other people than in those which we
cultivate ourselves. Sometimes, to
his inexpressible and fierce satisfaction,
Mr Stirn fell upon a knot of
boys pelting the swans; sometimes
he missed a young sapling, and found
it in felonious hands, converted into
a walking-stick; sometimes he caught
a hulking fellow scrambling up the
ha-ha! to gather a nosegay for his
sweetheart from one of poor Mrs
Hazeldean's pet parterres; not unfrequently,
indeed, when all the
family were fairly at church, some
curious impertinents forced or sneaked
their way into the gardens, in order
to peep in at the windows. For
these, and various other offences of
like magnitude, Mr Stirn had long,
but vainly, sought to induce the
Squire to withdraw a permission so
villanously abused. But though there
were times when Mr Hazeldean
grunted and growled, and swore
"that he would shut up the park,
and fill it (illegally) with man-traps
and spring-guns," his anger always
evaporated in words. The park was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
still open to all the world on a Sunday;
and that blessed day was therefore
converted into a day of travail
and wrath to Mr Stirn. But it was
from the last chime of the afternoon
service bell until dusk that the spirit
of this vigilant functionary was most
perturbed; for, amidst the flocks
that gathered from the little hamlets
round to the voice of the Pastor,
there were always some stray sheep,
or rather climbing desultory vagabond
goats, who struck off in all perverse
directions, as if for the special
purpose of distracting the energetic
watchfulness of Mr Stirn. As soon as
church was over, if the day were
fine, the whole park became a scene
animated with red cloaks, or lively
shawls, Sunday waistcoats, and hats
stuck full of wild-flowers&mdash;which
last Mr Stirn often stoutly maintained
to be Mrs Hazeldean's newest geraniums.
Now, on this Sunday especially,
there was an imperative call
upon an extra exertion of vigilance
on the part of the superintendent&mdash;he
had not only to detect ordinary
depredators and trespassers; but,
first, to discover the authors of the
conspiracy against the Stocks; and
secondly, to "make an example."</p>

<p>He had begun his rounds, therefore,
from the early morning; and
just as the afternoon bell was sounding
its final peal, he emerged upon
the village green from a hedgerow,
behind which he had been at watch
to observe who had the most suspiciously
gathered round the stocks.
At that moment the place was deserted.
At a distance, the superintendent
saw the fast disappearing
forms of some belated groups hastening
towards the church; in front, the
Stocks stood staring at him mournfully
from its four great eyes, which
had been cleansed from the mud, but
still looked bleared and stained with
the marks of the recent outrage.
Here Mr Stirn paused, took off his
hat, and wiped his brows.</p>

<p>"If I had sum un, to watch here,"
thought he, "while I takes a turn
by the water-side, praps summat
might come out; praps them as did
it ben't gone to church, but will come
sneaking round to look on their
willany! as they says murderers are
always led back to the place where
they ha' left the body. But in this
here willage there ben't a man,
woman, nor child, as has any consarn
for Squire or Parish, barring myself."
It was just as he arrived at
that misanthropical conclusion that
Mr Stirn beheld Leonard Fairfield
walking very fast from his own home.
The superintendent clapped on his
hat, and stuck his right arm akimbo.
"Hollo, you sir," said he, as Lenny
now came in hearing, "where be you
going at that rate?"</p>

<p>"Please, sir, I be going to church."</p>

<p>"Stop, sir&mdash;stop, Master Lenny.
Going to church!&mdash;why, the bell's
done; and you knows the Parson is
very angry at them as comes in
late, disturbing the congregation.
You can't go to church now!"</p>

<p>"Please, sir"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I says you can't go to church
now. You must learn to think a little
of others, lad. You sees how I sweats
to serve the Squire! and you must
serve him too. Why, your mother's
got the house and premishes almost
rent free: you ought to have a grateful
heart, Leonard Fairfield, and feel
for his honour! Poor man! <i>his</i> heart
is wellnigh bruk, I am sure, with the
goings on."</p>

<p>Leonard opened his innocent blue
eyes, while Mr Stirn dolorously wiped
his own.</p>

<p>"Look at that ere dumb cretur,"
said Stirn suddenly, pointing to the
Stocks&mdash;"look at it. If it could speak,
what would it say, Leonard Fairfield?
Answer me that!&mdash;'Damn the
Stocks, indeed!'"</p>

<p>"It was very bad in them to
write such naughty words," said
Lenny gravely. "Mother was quite
shocked when she heard of it, this
morning."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Stirn.</span>&mdash;"I dare she was, considering
what she pays for the premishes:
(insinuatingly,) you does not
know who did it&mdash;eh, Lenny?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lenny.</span>&mdash;"No, sir; indeed I does
not!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Stirn.</span>&mdash;"Well, you see, you
can't go to church&mdash;prayers half
over by this time. You recollex that I
put them stocks under your 'sponsibility,'
and see the way you's done your
duty by 'em. I've half a mind to,"&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr Stirn cast his eyes on the eyes
of the Stocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please, sir," began Lenny again,
rather frightened.</p>

<p>"No, I won't please; it ben't pleasing
at all. But I forgives you this
time, only keep a sharp look-out, lad,
in future. Now you just stay here&mdash;no,
there,&mdash;under the hedge, and
you watches if any persons come to
loiter about or looks at the Stocks,
or laughs to hisself, while I go my
rounds. I shall be back either afore
church is over or just arter; so you
stay till I comes, and give me your
report. Be sharp, boy, or it will be
worse for you and your mother: I can
let the premishes for four pounds a
year more, to-morrow."</p>

<p>Concluding with that somewhat
menacing and very significant remark,
and not staying for an answer, Mr
Stirn waved his hand, and walked off.</p>

<p>Poor Lenny remained by the Stocks,
very much dejected, and greatly disliking
the neighbourhood to which he
was consigned. At length he slowly
crept off to the hedge, and sate himself
down in the place of espionage
pointed out to him. Now, philosophers
tell us that what is called
the point of honour is a barbarous
feudal prejudice. Amongst the higher
classes, wherein those feudal prejudices
may be supposed to prevail,
Lenny Fairfield's occupation would
not have been considered peculiarly
honourable; neither would it have
seemed so to the more turbulent
spirits among the humbler orders, who
have a point of honour of their own,
which consists in the adherence to
each other in defiance of all lawful
authority. But to Lenny Fairfield,
brought up much apart from other
boys, and with a profound and
grateful reverence for the Squire instilled
into all his habits of thought,
notions of honour bounded themselves
to simple honesty and straightforward
truth; and as he cherished an
unquestioning awe of order and
constitutional authority, so it did not
appear to him that there was anything
derogatory and debasing in
being thus set to watch for an
offender. On the contrary, as he began
to reconcile himself to the loss of the
church service, and to enjoy the cool
of the summer shade, and the occasional
chirp of the birds, he got to
look on the bright side of the commission
to which he was deputed. In
youth, at least, everything has its
bright side&mdash;even the appointment of
Protector to the Parish Stocks. For
the Stocks, themselves, Leonard had
no affection, it is true; but he had
no sympathy with their aggressors,
and he could well conceive that the
Squire would be very much hurt at
the revolutionary event of the night.
"So," thought poor Leonard in his
simple heart&mdash;"so if I can serve his
honour, by keeping off mischievous
boys, or letting him know who did
the thing, I'm sure it would be a
proud day for mother." Then he
began to consider that, however ungraciously
Mr Stirn had bestowed on
him the appointment, still it was a
compliment to him&mdash;showed trust and
confidence in him, picked him out
from his contemporaries as the sober
moral pattern boy; and Lenny had a
great deal of pride in him, especially
in matters of repute and character.</p>

<p>All these things considered, I say,
Leonard Fairfield reclined in his lurking-place,
if not with positive delight
and intoxicating rapture, at least
with tolerable content and some complacency.</p>

<p>Mr Stirn might have been gone a
quarter of an hour, when a boy came
through a little gate in the park, just
opposite to Lenny's retreat in the
hedge, and, as if fatigued with walking,
or oppressed by the heat of the
day, paused on the green for a moment
or so, and then advanced under the
shade of the great tree which overhung
the Stocks.</p>

<p>Lenny pricked up his ears, and
peeped out jealously.</p>

<p>He had never seen the boy before:
it was a strange face to him.</p>

<p>Leonard Fairfield was not fond of
strangers; moreover, he had a vague
belief that strangers were at the bottom
of that desecration of the Stocks.
The boy, then, was a stranger; but what
was his rank? Was he of that grade
in society in which the natural offences
are or are not consonant to, or harmonious
with, outrages upon Stocks? On
that Lenny Fairfield did not feel quite
assured. According to all the experience
of the villager, the boy was not dressed
like a young gentleman. Leonard's
notions of such aristocratic costume
were naturally fashioned upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
model of Frank Hazeldean. They
represented to him a dazzling vision
of snow-white trousers, and beautiful
blue coats, and incomparable cravats.
Now the dress of this stranger, though
not that of a peasant nor of a farmer,
did not in any way correspond with
Lenny's notions of the costume of a
young gentleman: it looked to him
highly disreputable; the coat was
covered with mud, and the hat was
all manner of shapes, with a gap between
the side and crown.</p>

<p>Lenny was puzzled, till it suddenly
occurred to him that the gate through
which the boy had passed was in the
direct path across the park from a
small town, the inhabitants of which
were in very bad odour at the Hall&mdash;they
had immemorially furnished the
most daring poachers to the preserves,
the most troublesome trespassers on the
park, the most unprincipled orchard-robbers,
and the most disputatious
assertors of various problematical
rights of way, which, according to the
Town, were public, and, according to
the Hall, had been private since the
Conquest. It was true that the same
path led also directly from the Squire's
house, but it was not probable that
the wearer of attire so equivocal had
been visiting there. All things considered,
Lenny had no doubt in his
mind but that the stranger was a
shop-boy or 'prentice from the town of
Thorndyke; and the notorious repute
of that town, coupled with this presumption,
made it probable that Lenny
now saw before him one of the midnight
desecrators of the Stocks. As if
to confirm the suspicion, which passed
through Lenny's mind with a rapidity
wholly disproportionate to the number
of lines it costs me to convey it,
the boy, now standing right before the
Stocks, bent down and read that pithy
anathema with which it was defaced.
And having read it, he repeated it
aloud, and Lenny actually saw him
smile&mdash;such a smile!&mdash;so disagreeable
and sinister! Lenny had never before
seen the smile Sardonic.</p>

<p>But what were Lenny's pious horror
and dismay when this ominous stranger
fairly seated himself on the Stocks,
rested his heels profanely on the lids
of two of the four round eyes, and,
taking out a pencil and a pocket-book,
began to write. Was this audacious
Unknown taking an inventory of the
church and the Hall for the purposes
of conflagration? He looked at one,
and at the other, with a strange, fixed
stare as he wrote&mdash;not keeping his
eyes on the paper, as Lenny had been
taught to do when he sate down to his
copy-book. The fact is, that Randal
Leslie was tired and faint, and he felt
the shock of his fall the more, after the
few paces he had walked, so that
he was glad to rest himself a few moments;
and he took that opportunity
to write a line to Frank, to excuse
himself for not calling again, intending
to tear the leaf on which he wrote
out of his pocket-book, and leave it
at the first cottage he passed, with instructions
to take it to the Hall.</p>

<p>While Randal was thus innocently
engaged, Lenny came up to him, with
the firm and measured pace of one
who has resolved, cost what it may,
to do his duty. And as Lenny, though
brave, was not ferocious, so the anger
he felt, and the suspicions he entertained,
only exhibited themselves in
the following solemn appeal to the
offender's sense of propriety,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ben't you ashamed of yourself?
Sitting on the Squire's new Stocks!
Do get up, and go along with you!"</p>

<p>Randal turned round sharply; and
though, at any other moment, he
would have had sense enough to extricate
himself very easily from his
false position, yet, <i>Nemo mortalium</i>,
&amp;c. No one is always wise. And
Randal was in an exceedingly bad
humour. The affability towards his
inferiors, for which I lately praised
him, was entirely lost in the contempt
for impertinent snobs natural to an
insulted Etonian.</p>

<p>Therefore, eyeing Lenny with great
disdain, Randal answered briefly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are an insolent young blackguard."</p>

<p>So curt a rejoinder made Lenny's
blood fly to his face. Persuaded before
that the intruder was some lawless
apprentice or shop-lad, he was now
more confirmed in that judgment, not
only by language so uncivil, but by
the truculent glance which accompanied
it, and which certainly did not
derive any imposing dignity from the
mutilated, rakish, hang-dog, ruinous
hat, under which it shot its sullen and
menacing fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the various articles of
which our male attire is composed,
there is perhaps not one which has so
much character and expression as the
top-covering. A neat, well-brushed,
short-napped, gentlemanlike hat, put
on with a certain air, gives a distinction
and respectability to the whole
exterior; whereas a broken, squashed,
higgledy-piggledy sort of a hat, such
as Randal Leslie had on, would go far
towards transforming the stateliest
gentleman that ever walked down St
James's Street into the ideal of a
ruffianly scamp.</p>

<p>Now, it is well known that there is
nothing more antipathetic to your
peasant-boy than a shop-boy. Even
on grand political occasions, the rural
working-class can rarely be coaxed
into sympathy with the trading town-class.
Your true English peasant is
always an aristocrat. Moreover, and
irrespectively of this immemorial
grudge of class, there is something
peculiarly hostile in the relationship
between boy and boy when their backs
are once up, and they are alone on a
quiet bit of green. Something of the
game-cock feeling&mdash;something that
tends to keep alive, in the population of
this island, (otherwise so lamb-like
and peaceful,) the martial propensity to
double the thumb tightly over the four
fingers, and make what is called "a
fist of it." Dangerous symptoms of
these mingled and aggressive sentiments
were visible in Lenny Fairfield
at the words and the look of the
unprepossessing stranger. And the
stranger seemed aware of them; for
his pale face grew more pale, and
his sullen eye more fixed and more
vigilant.</p>

<p>"You get off them Stocks," said
Lenny, disdaining to reply to the coarse
expressions bestowed on him; and,
suiting the action to the word, he
gave the intruder what he meant for
a shove, but which Randal took for
a blow. The Etonian sprang up, and
the quickness of his movement, aided
but by a slight touch of his hand,
made Lenny lose his balance, and sent
him neck-and-crop over the Stocks.
Burning with rage, the young villager
rose alertly, and, flying at Randal,
struck out right and left.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>Aid me, O ye Nine! whom the incomparable
Persius satirised his contemporaries
for invoking, and then,
all of a sudden, invoked on his own
behalf&mdash;aid me to describe that
famous battle by the Stocks, and in
defence of the Stocks, which was
waged by the two representatives of
Saxon and Norman England. Here,
sober support of law and duty and delegated
trust&mdash;<i>pro aris et focis</i>; there,
haughty invasion, and bellicose spirit
of knighthood, and that respect for
name and person, which we call honour.
Here, too, hardy physical force&mdash;there,
skilful discipline. Here&mdash;The
Nine are as deaf as a post, and as
cold as a stone! Plague take the
jades!&mdash;I can do better without them.</p>

<p>Randal was a year older than
Lenny, but he was not so tall nor so
strong, nor even so active; and after
the first blind rush, when the two
boys paused, and drew back to
breathe, Lenny, eyeing the slight form
and hueless cheek of his opponent,
and seeing blood trickling from Randal's
lip, was seized with an instantaneous
and generous remorse. "It
was not fair," he thought, "to fight
one whom he could beat so easily."
So, retreating still farther, and letting
his arms fall to his side, he said
mildly&mdash;"There, let's have no more
of it; but go home and be good."</p>

<p>Randal Leslie had no remarkable
degree of that constitutional quality
called physical courage; but he had
all those moral qualities which supply
its place. He was proud&mdash;he was
vindictive&mdash;he had high self-esteem&mdash;he
had the destructive organ more
than the combative;&mdash;what had once
provoked his wrath it became his instinct
to sweep away. Therefore,
though all his nerves were quivering,
and hot tears were in his eyes, he
approached Lenny with the sternness
of a gladiator, and said between his
teeth, which he set hard, choking
back the sob of rage and pain&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have struck me&mdash;and you
shall not stir from this ground&mdash;till
I have made you repent it. Put up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
your hands&mdash;I will not strike you so&mdash;defend
yourself."</p>

<p>Lenny mechanically obeyed; and
he had good need of the admonition:
for if before he had had the advantage,
now that Randal had recovered
the surprise to his nerves, the battle
was not to the strong.</p>

<p>Though Leslie had not been a fighting
boy at Eton, still his temper had
involved him in some conflicts when
he was in the lower forms, and
he had learned something of the art
as well as the practice in pugilism&mdash;an
excellent thing, too, I am barbarous
enough to believe, and which I
hope will never quite die out of our
public schools. Ah, many a young
duke has been a better fellow for life
from a fair set-to with a trader's son;
and many a trader's son has learned
to look a lord more manfully in the
face on the hustings, from the recollection
of the sound thrashing he
once gave to some little Lord Leopold
Dawdle.</p>

<p>So Randal now brought his experience
and art to bear; put aside
those heavy roundabout blows, and
darted in his own, quick and sharp&mdash;supplying
the due momentum of pugilistic
mechanics to the natural feebleness
of his arm. Ay, and the arm,
too, was no longer so feeble: so strange
is the strength that comes from passion
and pluck!</p>

<p>Poor Lenny, who had never fought
before, was bewildered; his sensations
grew so entangled that he could
never recall them distinctly: he had
a dim reminiscence of some breathless
impotent rush&mdash;of a sudden blindness
followed by quick flashes of intolerable
light&mdash;of a deadly faintness, from
which he was roused by sharp pangs&mdash;here&mdash;there&mdash;everywhere;
and then
all he could remember was, that he
was lying on the ground, huddled up
and panting hard, while his adversary
bent over him with a countenance as
dark and livid as Lara himself might
have bent over the fallen Otho. For
Randal Leslie was not one who, by
impulse and nature, subscribed to the
noble English maxim&mdash;"Never hit a
foe when he is down;" and it cost
him a strong if brief self-struggle, not
to set his heel on that prostrate form.
It was the mind, not the heart, that
subdued the savage within him, as,
muttering something inwardly&mdash;certainly
not Christian forgiveness&mdash;the
victor turned gloomily away.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>Just at that precise moment, who
should appear but Mr Stirn! For, in
fact, being extremely anxious to get
Lenny into disgrace, he had hoped
that he should have found the young
villager had shirked the commission
intrusted to him; and the Right-hand
Man had slily come back, to see if that
amiable expectation were realised.
He now beheld Lenny rising with some
difficulty&mdash;still panting hard&mdash;and
with hysterical sounds akin to what is
vulgarly called blubbering&mdash;his fine
new waistcoat sprinkled with his own
blood, which flowed from his nose&mdash;nose
that seemed to Lenny Fairfield's
feelings to be a nose no more, but a
swollen, gigantic, mountainous Slawkenbergian
excrescence,&mdash;in fact, he
felt all nose! Turning aghast from
this spectacle, Mr Stirn surveyed, with
no more respect than Lenny had manifested,
the stranger boy, who had
again seated himself on the Stocks
(whether to recover his breath, or
whether to show that his victory was
consummated, and that he was in his
rights of possession.) "Hollo," said
Mr Stirn, "what is all this?&mdash;what's
the matter, Lenny, you blockhead?"</p>

<p>"He <i>will</i> sit there," answered
Lenny, in broken gasps, "and he
has beat me because I would not
let him; but I doesn't mind that,"
added the villager, trying hard to suppress
his tears, "and I'm ready again
for him&mdash;that I am."</p>

<p>"And what do you do, lolloping,
there on them blessed Stocks?"</p>

<p>"Looking at the landscape: out
of my light, man!"</p>

<p>This tone instantly inspired Mr
Stirn with misgivings: it was a tone
so disrespectful to him that he was
seized with involuntary respect: who
but a gentleman could speak so to
Mr Stirn?</p>

<p>"And may I ask who you be?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
said Stirn, falteringly, and half
inclined to touch his hat. "What's
your name, pray, and what's your
bizness?"</p>

<p>"My name is Randal Leslie, and
my business was to visit your master's
family&mdash;that is, if you are, as I guess
from your manner, Mr Hazeldean's
ploughman!"</p>

<p>So saying, Randal rose; and, moving
on a few paces, turned, and throwing
half-a-crown on the road, said to
Lenny,&mdash;"Let that pay you for your
bruises, and remember another time
how you speak to a gentleman. As
for you, fellow,"&mdash;and he pointed his
scornful hand towards Mr Stirn, who,
with his mouth open, and his hat
now fairly off, stood bowing to the
earth&mdash;"as for you, give my compliments
to Mr Hazeldean, and say
that, when he does us the honour to
visit us at Rood Hall, I trust that the
manners of our villagers will make
him ashamed of Hazeldean."</p>

<p>O my poor Squire! Rood Hall
ashamed of Hazeldean! If that message
had ever been delivered to you,
you would never have looked up
again!</p>

<p>With those bitter words, Randal
swung himself over the stile that led
into the parson's glebe, and left
Lenny Fairfield still feeling his nose,
and Mr Stirn still bowing to the
earth.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>Randal Leslie had a very long
walk home: he was bruised and sore
from head to foot, and his mind was
still more sore and more bruised than
his body. But if Randal Leslie had
rested himself in the Squire's gardens,
without walking backwards, and indulging
in speculations suggested by
Marat, and warranted by my Lord
Bacon, he would have passed a most
agreeable evening, and really availed
himself of the Squire's wealth by going
home in the Squire's carriage.
But because he chose to take so intellectual
a view of property, he
tumbled into a ditch; because he
tumbled into a ditch, he spoiled his
clothes; because he spoiled his clothes,
he gave up his visit; because he gave
up his visit, he got into the village
green, and sate on the Stocks with
a hat that gave him the air of a fugitive
from the treadmill; because he
sate on the Stocks&mdash;with that hat, and
a cross face under it&mdash;he had been
forced into the most discreditable
squabble with a clodhopper, and was
now limping home, at war with gods
and men;&mdash;<i>ergo</i>, (this is a moral that
will bear repetition)&mdash;<i>ergo</i>, when you
walk in a rich man's grounds, be
contented to enjoy what is yours,
namely, the prospect;&mdash;I dare say
you will enjoy it more than he does.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>If, in the simplicity of his heart, and
the crudeness of his experience,
Lenny Fairfield had conceived it probable
that Mr Stirn would address to
him some words in approbation of his
gallantry, and in sympathy for his
bruises, he soon found himself wofully
mistaken. That truly great man,
worthy prime-minister of Hazeldean,
might, perhaps, pardon a dereliction
from his orders, if such dereliction
proved advantageous to the interests
of the service, or redounded to the
credit of the chief; but he was inexorable
to that worst of diplomatic
offences&mdash;an ill-timed, stupid, overzealous
obedience to orders, which,
if it established the devotion of the
<i>employ&eacute;</i>, got the employer into what
is popularly called a scrape! And
though, by those unversed in the intricacies
of the human heart, and unacquainted
with the especial hearts of
prime-ministers and Right-hand men,
it might have seemed natural that Mr
Stirn, as he stood still, hat in hand,
in the middle of the road, stung,
humbled, and exasperated by the
mortification he had received from
the lips of Randal Leslie, would
have felt that that young gentleman
was the proper object of his resentment;
yet such a breach of all the
etiquette of diplomatic life as resentment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
towards a superior power was
the last idea that would have suggested
itself to the profound intellect
of the Premier of Hazeldean. Still,
as rage like steam must escape somewhere,
Mr Stirn, on feeling&mdash;as he
afterwards expressed it to his wife&mdash;that
his "buzzom was a burstin,"
turned with the natural instinct of
self-preservation to the safety-valve
provided for the explosion; and the
vapours within him rushed into vent
upon Lenny Fairfield. He clapped
his hat on his head fiercely, and thus
relieved his "buzzom."</p>

<p>"You young willain! you howdacious
wiper! and so all this blessed
Sabbath afternoon, when you ought to
have been in church on your marrow
bones, a-praying for your betters, you
has been a-fitting with a young gentleman,
and a wisiter to your master, on
the werry place of the parridge hinstitution
that you was to guard and
pertect; and a-bloodying it all over,
I declares, with your blaggard little
nose!" Thus saying, and as if to
mend the matter, Mr Stirn aimed an
additional stroke at the offending
member; but, Lenny mechanically
putting up both his arms to defend
his face, Mr Stirn struck his knuckles
against the large brass buttons that
adorned the cuff of the boy's coat-sleeve&mdash;an
incident which considerably
aggravated his indignation.
And Lenny, whose spirit was fairly
roused at what the narrowness of his
education conceived to be a signal injustice,
placing the trunk of the tree
between Mr Stirn and himself, began
that task of self-justification which it
was equally impolitic to conceive and
imprudent to execute, since, in such a
case, to justify was to recriminate.</p>

<p>"I wonder at you, Master Stirn,&mdash;if
mother could hear you! You
know it was you who would not let
me go to church; it was you who
told me to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fit a young gentleman, and
break the Sabbath," said Mr Stirn,
interrupting him with a withering
sneer. "O yes! I told you to disgrace
his honour the Squire, and me,
and the parridge, and bring us all
into trouble. But the Squire told me
to make an example, and I will!"
With those words, quick as lightning
flashed upon Mr Stirn's mind the
luminous idea of setting Lenny in the
very Stocks which he had too faithfully
guarded. Eureka! the "example"
was before him! Here, he could gratify
his long grudge against the pattern
boy; here, by such a selection of the
very best lad in the parish, he
could strike terror into the worst;
here he could appease the offended
dignity of Randal Leslie; here was a
practical apology to the Squire for the
affront put upon his young visitor;
here, too, there was prompt obedience
to the Squire's own wish that the
Stocks should be provided as soon as
possible with a tenant. Suiting the
action to the thought, Mr Stirn made
a rapid plunge at his victim, caught
him by the skirt of his jacket, and, in
a few seconds more, the jaws of the
Stocks had opened, and Lenny Fairfield
was thrust therein&mdash;a sad spectacle
of the reverses of fortune. This
done, and while the boy was too
astounded, too stupefied by the suddenness
of the calamity for the resistance
he might otherwise have made&mdash;nay,
for more than a few inaudible
words&mdash;Mr Stirn hurried from the spot,
but not without first picking up and
pocketing the half-crown designed for
Lenny, and which, so great had been
his first emotions, he had hitherto even
almost forgotten. He then made his
way towards the church, with the intention
to place himself close by the
door, catch the Squire as he came out,
whisper to him what had passed, and
lead him, with the whole congregation
at his heels, to gaze upon the sacrifice
offered up to the joint Powers of
Nemesis and Themis.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>Unaffectedly I say it&mdash;upon the
honour of a gentleman, and the reputation
of an author, unaffectedly I
say it&mdash;no words of mine can do justice
to the sensations experienced by
Lenny Fairfield, as he sate alone in
that place of penance. He felt no
more the physical pain of his bruises;
the anguish of his mind stifled and
overbore all corporeal suffering&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
anguish as great as the childish breast
is capable of holding. For first and
deepest of all, and earliest felt, was
the burning sense of injustice. He
had, it might be with erring judgment,
but with all honesty, earnestness,
and zeal, executed the commission
intrusted to him; he had stood
forth manfully in discharge of his
duty; he had fought for it, suffered
for it, bled for it. This was his reward!
Now, in Lenny's mind there
was pre-eminently that quality which
distinguishes the Anglo-Saxon race&mdash;the
sense of justice. It was perhaps
the strongest principle in his moral
constitution; and the principle had
never lost its virgin bloom and freshness
by any of the minor acts of
oppression and iniquity which boys
of higher birth often suffer from
harsh parents, or in tyrannical
schools. So that it was for the first
time that that iron entered into his
soul, and with it came its attendant
feeling&mdash;the wrathful galling sense of
impotence. He had been wronged,
and he had no means to right himself.
Then came another sensation, if not so
deep, yet more smarting and envenomed
for the time&mdash;shame! He, the
good boy of all good boys&mdash;he, the
pattern of the school, and the pride of
the parson&mdash;he, whom the Squire, in
sight of all his contemporaries, had
often singled out to slap on the back,
and the grand Squire's lady to pat on
the head, with a smiling gratulation
on his young and fair repute&mdash;he, who
had already learned so dearly to prize
the sweets of an honourable name&mdash;he,
to be made, as it were, in the
twinkling of an eye, a mark for opprobrium,
a butt of scorn, a jeer, and a
byword! The streams of his life
were poisoned at the fountain. And
then came a tenderer thought of his
mother! of the shock this would be to
her&mdash;she who had already begun to
look up to him as her stay and
support: he bowed his head, and
the tears, long suppressed, rolled
down.</p>

<p>Then he wrestled and struggled,
and strove to wrench his limbs from
that hateful bondage;&mdash;for he heard
steps approaching. And he began to
picture to himself the arrival of all the
villagers from church, the sad gaze of
the Parson, the bent brow of the
Squire, the idle ill-suppressed titter of
all the boys, jealous of his unblotted
character&mdash;character of which the
original whiteness could never, never
be restored! He would always be
the boy who had sate in the Stocks!
And the words uttered by the Squire
came back on his soul, like the voice
of conscience in the ears of some
doomed Macbeth. "A sad disgrace,
Lenny&mdash;you'll never be in such a
quandary." "Quandary," the word
was unfamiliar to him; it must mean
something awfully discreditable. The
poor boy could have prayed for the
earth to swallow him.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>"Kettles and frying-pans! what
has us here?" cried the tinker.</p>

<p>This time Mr Sprott was without
his donkey; for, it being Sunday, it
is to be presumed that the donkey
was enjoying his Sabbath on the
Common. The tinker was in his
Sunday's best, clean and smart, about
to take his lounge in the park.</p>

<p>Lenny Fairfield made no answer to
the appeal.</p>

<p>"You in the wood, my baby!
Well, that's the last sight I should
ha' thought to see. But we all lives
to larn," added the tinker sententiously.
"Who gave you them leggins?
Can't you speak, lad?"</p>

<p>"Nick Stirn."</p>

<p>"Nick Stirn! Ay, I'd ha' ta'en my
davy on that: and cos vy?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I did as he told me, and
fought a boy as was trespassing on
these very Stocks; and he beat me&mdash;but
I don't care for that; and that boy
was a young gentleman, and going to
visit the Squire; and so Nick Stirn&mdash;"
Lenny stopped short, choked by rage
and humiliation.</p>

<p>"Augh," said the tinker, staring,
"you fit with a young gentleman, did
you? Sorry to hear you confess that,
my lad! Sit there, and be thankful
you ha' got off so cheap. 'Tis salt
and battery to fit with your betters,
and a Lunnon justice o' peace would
have given you two months o' the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
treadmill. But vy should you fit cos
he trespassed on the Stocks? It ben't
your natural side for fitting, I takes it."</p>

<p>Lenny murmured something not
very distinguishable about serving the
Squire, and doing as he was bid.</p>

<p>"Oh, I sees, Lenny," interrupted
the tinker, in a tone of great contempt,
"you be one o' those who
would rayther 'unt with the 'ounds
than run with the 'are! You be's
the good pattern boy, and would
peach agin your own border to curry
favour with the grand folks. Fie,
lad! you be sarved right: stick by
your horder, then you'll be 'spected
when you gets into trouble, and not
be 'varsally 'espised&mdash;as you'll be arter
church-time! Vell, I can't be seen
'sorting with you, now you are in this
here drogotary fix; it might hurt my
cracter, both with them as built the
Stocks, and them as wants to pull 'em
down. Old kettles to mend! Vy,
you makes me forgit the Sabbath.
Sarvent, my lad, and wish you well
out of it; 'specks to your mother, and
say we can deal for the pan and shovel
all the same for your misfortin."</p>

<p>The tinker went his way. Lenny's
eye followed him with the sullenness
of despair. The tinker, like all the
tribe of human comforters, had only
watered the brambles to invigorate
the prick of the thorns. Yes, if
Lenny had been caught breaking the
Stocks, some at least would have pitied
him; but to be incarcerated for defending
them, you might as well have
expected that the widows and orphans
of the Reign of Terror would have
pitied Dr Guillotin when he slid
through the grooves of his own deadly
machine. And even the tinker, itinerant,
ragamuffin vagabond as he was,
felt ashamed to be found with the
pattern boy! Lenny's head sank
again on his breast, heavily as if
it had been of lead. Some few minutes
thus passed, when the unhappy prisoner
became aware of the presence
of another spectator to his shame: he
heard no step, but he saw a shadow
thrown over the sward. He held his
breath, and would not look up, with
some vague idea that if he refused to
see he might escape being seen.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>"<i>Per Bacco!</i>" said Dr Riccabocca,
putting his hand on Lenny's shoulder,
and bending down to look into his face&mdash;"<i>Per
Bacco!</i> my young friend, do
you sit here from choice or necessity?"</p>

<p>Lenny slightly shuddered, and
winced under the touch of one whom
he had hitherto regarded with a sort
of superstitious abhorrence.</p>

<p>"I fear," resumed Riccabocca, after
waiting in vain for an answer to his
question, "that, though the situation
is charming, you did not select it yourself.
What is this?"&mdash;and the irony
of the tone vanished&mdash;"what is this,
my poor boy? You have been bleeding,
and I see that those tears which
you try to cheek come from a deep
well. Tell me, <i>povero fanciullo mio</i>,
(the sweet Italian vowels, though
Lenny did not understand them,
sounded softly and soothingly,)&mdash;tell
me, my child, how all this happened.
Perhaps I can help you&mdash;we have all
erred; we should all help each other."</p>

<p>Lenny's heart, that just before had
seemed bound in brass, found itself a
way as the Italian spoke thus kindly,
and the tears rushed down; but he
again stopped them, and gulped out
sturdily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have not done no wrong; it
ben't my fault&mdash;and 'tis that which
kills me!" concluded Lenny, with a
burst of energy.</p>

<p>"You have not done wrong?
Then," said the philosopher, drawing
out his pocket-handkerchief with
great composure, and spreading it on
the ground&mdash;"then I may sit beside
you. I could only stoop pityingly
over sin, but I can lie down on equal
terms with misfortune."</p>

<p>Lenny Fairfield did not quite comprehend
the words, but enough of
their general meaning was apparent
to make him cast a grateful
glance on the Italian. Riccabocca
resumed, as he adjusted the pocket-handkerchief,
"I have a right to your
confidence, my child, for I have been
afflicted in my day: yet I too say
with thee, 'I have not done wrong.'
<i>Cospetto!</i>" (and here the Dr seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
himself deliberately, resting one arm
on the side column of the Stocks, in
familiar contact with the captive's
shoulder, while his eye wandered over
the lovely scene around)&mdash;"<i>Cospetto!</i>
my prison, if they had caught me,
would not have had so fair a look-out
as this. But, to be sure, it is all one:
there are no ugly loves, and no
handsome prisons!"</p>

<p>With that sententious maxim, which,
indeed, he uttered in his native Italian,
Riccabocca turned round and renewed
his soothing invitations to confidence.
A friend in need is a friend indeed,
even if he come in the guise of a
Papist and wizard. All Lenny's
ancient dislike to the foreigner had
gone, and he told him his little tale.</p>

<p>Dr Riccabocca was much too shrewd
a man not to see exactly the motives
which had induced Mr Stirn to incarcerate
his agent, (barring only that of
personal grudge, to which Lenny's
account gave him no clue.) That a
man high in office should make a
scape-goat of his own watch-dog for
an unlucky snap, or even an indiscreet
bark, was nothing strange to the
wisdom of the student of Machiavelli.
However, he set himself to the task
of consolation with equal philosophy
and tenderness. He began by reminding,
or rather informing, Leonard
Fairfield of all the instances of illustrious
men afflicted by the injustice
of others that occurred to his own
excellent memory. He told him how
the great Epictetus, when in slavery,
had a master whose favourite amusement
was pinching his leg, which, as
the amusement ended in breaking that
limb, was worse than the Stocks. He
also told him the anecdote of Lenny's
own gallant countryman, Admiral
Byng, whose execution gave rise to
Voltaire's celebrated witticism, "<i>En
Angleterre on tue un amiral pour
encourager les autres</i>." ("In England
they execute one admiral in order to
encourage the others.") Many more
illustrations, still more pertinent to
the case in point, his erudition supplied
from the stores of history. But
on seeing that Lenny did not seem
in the slightest degree consoled by
these memorable examples, he shifted
his ground, and, reducing his logic to
the strict <i>argumentum ad rem</i>, began
to prove, 1st, that there was no disgrace
at all in Lenny's present position,
that every equitable person
would recognise the tyranny of Stirn
and the innocence of its victim; 2dly,
that if even here he were mistaken,
for public opinion was not always
righteous, what was public opinion
after all?&mdash;"A breath&mdash;a puff," cried
Dr Riccabocca&mdash;"a thing without
matter&mdash;without length, breadth, or
substance&mdash;a shadow&mdash;a goblin of our
own creating. A man's own conscience
is his sole tribunal, and he should care
no more for that phantom 'opinion'
than he should fear meeting a ghost
if he cross the churchyard at dark."</p>

<p>Now, as Lenny did very much fear
meeting a ghost if he crossed the
churchyard at dark, the simile spoiled
the argument, and he shook his head
very mournfully. Dr Riccabocca was
about to enter into a third course of
reasoning, which, had it come to an
end, would doubtless have settled the
matter, and reconciled Lenny to
sitting in the Stocks till doomsday,
when the captive, with the quick ear
and eye of terror and calamity, became
conscious that church was over,
that the congregation in a few seconds
more would be flocking thitherwards.
He saw visionary hats and bonnets
through the trees, which Riccabocca
saw not, despite all the excellence of
his spectacles&mdash;heard phantasmal
rustlings and murmurings which Riccabocca
heard not, despite all that
theoretical experience in plots, stratagems,
and treasons, which should have
made the Italian's ear as fine as a
conspirator's or a mole's. And, with
another violent but vain effort at
escape, the prisoner exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could but get out before
they come! Let me out&mdash;let me out.
O, kind sir, have pity&mdash;let me out!"</p>

<p>"<i>Diavolo!</i>" said the philosopher,
startled, "I wonder that never occurred
to me before. After all, I believe he
has hit the right nail on the head;"
and, looking close, he perceived that
though the partition wood had hitched
firmly into a sort of spring-clasp,
which defied Lenny's unaided struggles,
still it was not locked, (for,
indeed, the padlock and key were
snug in the justice-room of the Squire,
who never dreamt that his orders
would be executed so literally and
summarily as to dispense with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
formal appeal to himself.) As soon
as Dr Riccabocca made that discovery,
it occurred to him that all the wisdom
of all the schools that ever existed
can't reconcile man or boy to a bad
position, the moment there is a fair
opportunity of letting him out of it.
Accordingly, without more ado, he
lifted up the creaking board, and
Lenny Fairfield darted forth like a
bird from a cage&mdash;halted a moment
as if for breath, or in joy; and then,
taking at once to his heels, fled, fast
as a hare to its form&mdash;fast to his
mother's home.</p>

<p>Dr Riccabocca dropped the yawning
wood into its place, picked up his
handkerchief and restored it to his
pocket; and then, with some curiosity,
began to examine the nature of that
place of duress which had caused so
much painful emotion to its rescued
victim.</p>

<p>"Man is a very irrational animal
at best," quoth the sage, soliloquising,
"and is frightened by strange bugaboos!
'Tis but a piece of wood!
how little it really injures; and, after
all, the holes are but rests to the legs,
and keep the feet out of the dirt.
And this green bank to sit upon&mdash;under
the shade of the elm-tree&mdash;verily
the position must be more pleasant
than otherwise! I've a great mind&mdash;"
Here the Doctor looked around, and,
seeing the coast still clear, the oddest
notion imaginable took possession
of him; yet not indeed a notion
so odd, considered philosophically&mdash;for
all philosophy is based on practical
experiment&mdash;and Dr Riccabocca
felt an irresistible desire practically
to experience what manner of
thing that punishment of the Stocks
really was. "I can but try!&mdash;only
for a moment," said he apologetically
to his own expostulating sense of
dignity. "I have time to do it, before
any one comes." He lifted up the
partition again: but Stocks are built
on the true principle of English law,
and don't easily allow a man to criminate
himself&mdash;it was hard to get
into them without the help of a friend.
However, as we before noticed, obstacles
only whetted Dr Riccabocca's
invention. He looked round and saw
a withered bit of stick under the tree&mdash;this
he inserted in the division of the
Stocks, somewhat in the manner in
which boys place a stick under a sieve
for the purpose of ensnaring sparrows:
the fatal wood thus propped, Dr
Riccabocca sate gravely down on the
bank, and thrust his feet through the
apertures.</p>

<p>"Nothing in it!" cried he triumphantly,
after a moment's deliberation.
"The evil is only in idea. Such is the
boasted reason of mortals!" With
that reflection, nevertheless, he was
about to withdraw his feet from their
voluntary dilemma, when the crazy
stick suddenly gave way, and the partition
fell back into its clasp. Doctor
Riccabocca was fairly caught&mdash;"<i>Facilis
descensus&mdash;sed revocare gradum!</i>"
True, his hands were at liberty, but his
legs were so long that, being thus
fixed, they kept the hands from the
rescue; and as Dr Riccabocca's form
was by no means supple, and the twin
parts of the wood stuck together with
that firmness of adhesion which things
newly painted possess, so, after some
vain twists and contortions, in which
he succeeded at length (not without a
stretch of the sinews that made them
crack again) in finding the clasp and
breaking his nails thereon, the victim
of his own rash experiment resigned
himself to his fate. Dr Riccabocca
was one of those men who never do
things by halves. When I say he resigned
himself, I mean not only Christian
but philosophical resignation.
The position was not quite so pleasant
as, theoretically, he had deemed it;
but he resolved to make himself as
comfortable as he could. And first,
as is natural in all troubles to men
who have grown familiar with that
odoriferous comforter which Sir Walter
Raleigh is said first to have bestowed
upon the Caucasian races, the Doctor
made use of his hands to extract from
his pocket his pipe, match-box, and
tobacco-pouch. After a few whiffs he
would have been quite reconciled to
his situation, but for the discovery
that the sun had shifted its place in
the heavens, and was no longer shaded
from his face by the elm-tree. The Doctor
again looked round, and perceived
that his red silk umbrella, which he
had laid aside when he had seated
himself by Lenny, was within arm's
reach. Possessing himself of this
treasure, he soon expanded its friendly
folds. And thus doubly fortified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
within and without, under shade of
the umbrella, and his pipe composedly
between his lips, Dr Riccabocca gazed
on his own incarcerated legs, even
with complacency.</p>

<p>"'He who can despise all things,'"
said he, in one of his native proverbs,
"'possesses all things!'&mdash;if one despises
freedom, one is free! This seat
is as soft as a sofa! I am not sure,"
he resumed, soliloquising, after a
pause&mdash;"I am not sure that there is
not something more witty than manly
and philosophical in that national proverb
of mine which I quoted to the
<i>fanciullo</i>, that there are no handsome
prisons! Did not the son of that celebrated
Frenchman, surnamed <i>Bras de
Fer</i>, write a book not only to prove
that adversities are more necessary
than prosperities, but that among all
adversities a prison is the most pleasant
and profitable?<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But is not this
condition of mine, voluntarily and
experimentally incurred, a type of my
life? Is it the first time that I have
thrust myself into a hobble?&mdash;and if
in a hobble of mine own choosing,
why should I blame the gods?"</p>

<p>Upon this Dr Riccabocca fell into a
train of musing so remote from time
and place, that in a few minutes he
no more remembered that he was in
the Parish Stocks, than a lover remembers
that flesh is grass, a miser that
mammon is perishable, a philosopher
that wisdom is vanity.&mdash;Dr Riccabocca
was in the clouds.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p>The dullest dog that ever wrote
a novel (and, <i>entre nous</i>, reader&mdash;but
let it go no farther&mdash;we have a good
many dogs among the fraternity that
are not Munitos,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>) might have seen
with half an eye that the Parson's
discourse had produced a very genial
and humanising effect upon his audience.
When all was over, and the
congregation stood up to let Mr
Hazeldean and his family walk first
down the aisle, (for that was the custom
at Hazeldean,) moistened eyes
glanced at the Squire's sun-burned,
manly face with a kindness that bespoke
revived memory of many a
generous benefit and ready service.
The head might be wrong now and
then&mdash;the heart was in the right place
after all. And the lady, leaning on
his arm, came in for a large share of
that gracious good feeling. True, she
now and then gave a little offence
when the cottages were not so clean
as she fancied they ought to be&mdash;and
poor folks don't like a liberty taken
with their houses any more than the
rich do; true, that she was not quite so
popular with the women as the Squire
was, for, if the husband went too often
to the alehouse, she always laid the fault
on the wife, and said, "No man would
go out of doors for his comforts, if he
had a smiling face and a clean hearth
at his home;" whereas the Squire
maintained the more gallant opinion,
that "if Gill was a shrew, it was because
Jack did not, as in duty bound,
stop her mouth with a kiss!" Still,
notwithstanding these more obnoxious
notions on her part, and a certain awe
inspired by the stiff silk gown and the
handsome aquiline nose, it was impossible,
especially in the softened tempers
of that Sunday afternoon, not to
associate the honest, comely, beaming
countenance of Mrs Hazeldean with
comfortable recollections of soups, jellies,
and wine in sickness, loaves and
blankets in winter, cheering words
and ready visits in every little distress,
and pretexts afforded by improvement
in the grounds and gardens (improvements
which, as the Squire, who
preferred productive labour, justly
complained, "would never finish")
for little timely jobs of work to some
veteran grandsire, who still liked to
earn a penny, or some ruddy urchin
in a family that "came too fast." Nor
was Frank, as he walked a little behind,
in the whitest of trousers and
the stiffest of neckcloths&mdash;with a look
of suppressed roguery in his bright
hazel eye, that contrasted his assumed
stateliness of mien&mdash;without his portion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>of the silent blessing. Not that
he had done anything yet to deserve
it; but we all give youth so large a
credit in the future. As for Miss
Jemima, her trifling foibles only rose
from too soft and feminine a susceptibility,
too ivy-like a yearning for
some masculine oak, whereon to entwine
her tendrils; and so little confined
to self was the natural lovingness
of her disposition, that she had
helped many a village lass to find a
husband, by the bribe of a marriage
gift from her own privy purse; notwithstanding
the assurances with
which she accompanied the marriage
gift,&mdash;viz., that "the bridegroom
would turn out like the rest of his ungrateful
sex; but that it was a comfort
to think that it would be all one
in the approaching crash." So that
she had her warm partisans, especially
amongst the young; while the slim
Captain, on whose arm she rested her
forefinger, was at least a civil-spoken
gentleman, who had never done any
harm, and who would doubtless do a
deal of good if he belonged to the
parish. Nay, even the fat footman,
who came last with the family Prayerbook,
had his due share in the general
association of neighbourly kindness
between hall and hamlet. Few were
there present to whom he had not extended
the right-hand of fellowship,
with a full horn of October in the
clasp of it: and he was a Hazeldean
man, too, born and bred, as two-thirds
of the Squire's household (now letting
themselves out from their large pew
under the gallery) were.</p>

<p>On his part, too, you could see that
the Squire was 'moved withal,' and
a little humbled moreover. Instead
of walking erect, and taking bow and
curtsey as matter of course, and of no
meaning, he hung his head somewhat,
and there was a slight blush on his
cheek; and as he glanced upward and
round him&mdash;shyly, as it were&mdash;and his
eye met those friendly looks, it returned
them with an earnestness that
had in it something touching as well
as cordial&mdash;an eye that said, as well
as eye could say, "I don't quite deserve
it, I fear, neighbours; but I
thank you for your goodwill with my
whole heart." And so readily was
that glance of the eye understood,
that I think, if that scene had taken
place out of doors instead of in the
church, there would have been an
hurrah as the Squire passed out of
sight.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Mr Hazeldean got well
out of the churchyard, ere Mr Stirn
was whispering in his ear. As Stirn
whispered, the Squire's face grew long,
and his colour changed. The congregation,
now flocking out of the church,
exchanged looks with each other;
that ominous conjunction between
Squire and man chilled back all the
effects of the Parson's sermon. The
Squire struck his cane violently into
the ground. "I would rather you
had told me Black Bess had got the
glanders. A young gentleman, coming
to visit my son, struck and insulted
in Hazeldean; a young gentleman&mdash;'sdeath,
sir, a relation&mdash;his grandmother
was a Hazeldean. I do believe
Jemima's right, and the world's coming
to an end! But Leonard Fairfield
in the Stocks! What will the Parson
say? and after such a sermon! 'Rich
man, respect the poor!' And the
good widow too; and poor Mark, who
almost died in my arms. Stirn, you
have a heart of stone! You confounded,
lawless, merciless miscreant, who
the deuce gave you the right to imprison
man or boy in my parish of
Hazeldean without trial, sentence,
or warrant? Run and let the boy
out before any one sees him: run, or
I shall."&mdash;The Squire elevated the
cane, and his eyes shot fire. Mr Stirn
did not run, but he walked off very
fast. The Squire drew back a few
paces, and again took his wife's arm.
"Just wait a bit for the Parson, while
I talk to the congregation. I want to
stop 'em all, if I can, from going into
the village; but how?"</p>

<p>Frank heard, and replied readily&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give 'em some beer, sir."</p>

<p>"Beer! on a Sunday! For shame,
Frank!" cried Mrs Hazeldean.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Harry. Thank
you, Frank," said the Squire, and his
brow grew as clear as the blue sky
above him. I doubt if Riccabocca
could have got him out of his dilemma
with the same ease as Frank had done.</p>

<p>"Halt there, my men&mdash;lads and
lasses too&mdash;there, halt a bit. Mrs
Fairfield, do you hear?&mdash;halt! I think
his reverence has given us a capital
sermon. Go tip to the Great House all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of you, and drink a glass to his
health. Frank, go with them; and
tell Spruce to tap one of the casks
kept for the haymakers. Harry,
[this in a whisper,] catch the Parson,
and tell him to come to me instantly."</p>

<p>"My dear Hazeldean, what has
happened? you are mad."</p>

<p>"Don't bother&mdash;do what I tell you."</p>

<p>"But where is the Parson to find
you?"</p>

<p>"Where, gad zooks, Mrs H.,&mdash;at
the Stocks to be sure!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p>Dr Riccabocca, awakened out of his
reverie by the sound of footsteps&mdash;was
still so little sensible of the indignity
of his position, that he enjoyed
exceedingly, and with all the malice
of his natural humour, the astonishment
and stupor manifested by Stirn,
when that functionary beheld the
extraordinary substitute which fate
and philosophy had found for Lenny
Fairfield. Instead of the weeping,
crushed, broken-hearted captive whom
he had reluctantly come to deliver,
he stared, speechless and aghast, upon
the grotesque but tranquil figure of
the Doctor, enjoying his pipe and
cooling himself under his umbrella,
with a <i>sang-froid</i> that was truly appalling
and diabolical. Indeed, considering
that Stirn always suspected
the Papisher of having had a hand in
the whole of that black and midnight
business, in which the Stocks had been
broken, bunged up, and consigned to
perdition, and that the Papisher had
the evil reputation of dabbling in the
Black Art, the hocus-pocus way in
which the Lenny he had incarcerated
was transformed into the Doctor he
found, conjoined with the peculiarly
strange, eldritch, and Mephistophelean
physiognomy and person of Riccabocca,
could not but strike a thrill
of superstitious dismay into the breast
of the parochial tyrant. While to his
first confused and stammered exclamations
and interrogatories, Riccabocca
replied with so tragic an air,
such ominous shakes of the head, such
mysterious, equivocating, long-worded
sentences, that Stirn every moment
felt more and more convinced that the
boy had sold himself to the Powers
of Darkness; and that he himself,
prematurely, and in the flesh, stood
face to face with the Arch-Enemy.</p>

<p>Mr Stirn had not yet recovered his
wonted intelligence, which, to do him
justice, was usually prompt enough&mdash;when
the Squire, followed hard by
the Parson, arrived at the spot.
Indeed, Mrs Hazeldean's report of the
Squire's urgent message, disturbed
manner, and most unparalleled invitation
to the parishioners, had given
wings to Parson Dale's ordinarily slow
and sedate movements. And while
the Squire, sharing Stirn's amazement,
beheld indeed a great pair of feet projecting
from the stocks, and saw
behind them the grave face of Doctor
Riccabocca, under the majestic shade
of the umbrella, but not a vestige of
the only being his mind could identify
with the tenancy of the Stocks, Mr
Dale, catching him by the arm, and
panting hard, exclaimed with a petulance
he had never before been known
to display&mdash;except at the whist-table,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr Hazeldean, Mr Hazeldean, I
am scandalised&mdash;I am shocked at you.
I can bear a great deal from you, sir,
as I ought to do; but to ask my
whole congregation, the moment after
divine service, to go up and guzzle ale
at the Hall, and drink my health, as
if a clergyman's sermon had been a
speech at a cattle-fair! I am ashamed
of you, and of the parish! What on
earth has come to you all?"</p>

<p>"That's the very question I wish
to heaven I could answer," groaned
the Squire, quite mildly and pathetically&mdash;"What
on earth has come to us
all! Ask Stirn:" (then bursting out)
"Stirn, you infernal rascal, don't you
hear?&mdash;what on earth has come to
us all?"</p>

<p>"The Papisher is at the bottom of
it, sir," said Stirn, provoked out of all
temper. "I does my duty, but I is but
a mortal man, arter all."</p>

<p>"A mortal fiddlestick&mdash;where's
Leonard Fairfield, I say?"</p>

<p>"<i>Him</i> knows best," answered Stirn,
retreating mechanically, for safety's
sake, behind the Parson, and pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to Dr Riccabocca. Hitherto, though
both the Squire and Parson had indeed
recognised the Italian, they had
merely supposed him to be seated on
the bank. It never entered into their
heads that so respectable and dignified
a man could by any possibility be an
inmate, compelled or voluntary, of the
Parish Stocks. No, not even though,
as I before said, the Squire had seen,
just under his nose, a very long pair
of soles inserted in the apertures&mdash;that
sight had only confused and
bewildered him, unaccompanied as it
ought to have been with the trunk
and face of Lenny Fairfield. Those
soles seemed to him optical delusions,
phantoms of the overheated brain;
but now, catching hold of Stirn, while
the Parson in equal astonishment
caught hold of him&mdash;the Squire
faltered out, "Well, this beats cock-fighting!
The man's as mad as a
March hare, and has taken Dr Rickey-bockey
for little Lenny!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the Doctor, breaking
silence, with a bland smile, and
attempting an inclination of the head
as courteous as his position would
permit&mdash;"perhaps, if it be quite the
same to you, before you proceed to
explanations,&mdash;you will just help me
out of the Stocks."</p>

<p>The Parson, despite his perplexity
and anger, could not repress a smile,
as he approached his learned friend,
and bent down for the purpose of
extricating him.</p>

<p>"Lord love your reverence, you'd
better not!" cried Mr Stirn. "Don't
be tempted&mdash;he only wants to get you
into his claws. I would not go a-near
him for all the&mdash;"</p>

<p>The speech was interrupted by Dr
Riccabocca himself, who now, thanks
to the Parson, had risen into his full
height, and half a head taller than all
present&mdash;even than the tall Squire&mdash;approached
Mr Stirn, with a gracious
wave of the hand. Mr Stirn retreated
rapidly towards the hedge, amidst the
brambles of which he plunged himself
incontinently.</p>

<p>"I guess whom you take me for,
Mr Stirn," said the Italian, lifting his
hat with his characteristic politeness.
"It is certainly a great honour; but
you will know better one of these
days, when the gentleman in question
admits you to a personal interview
in another and&mdash;a hotter
world."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p>"But how on earth did you get into
my new Stocks?" asked the Squire,
scratching his head.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, Pliny the elder got
into the crater of Mount Etna."</p>

<p>"Did he, and what for?"</p>

<p>"To try what it was like, I suppose,"
answered Riccabocca.</p>

<p>The Squire burst out a-laughing.</p>

<p>"And so you got into the Stocks to
try what it was like. Well, I can't
wonder&mdash;it is a very handsome pair of
Stocks," continued the Squire, with a
loving look at the object of his praise.
"Nobody need be ashamed of being
seen in those Stocks&mdash;I should not
mind it myself."</p>

<p>"We had better move on," said
the Parson drily, "or we shall be
having the whole village here presently,
gazing on the lord of the
manor in the same predicament as
that from which we have just extricated
the Doctor. Now pray, what
is the matter with Lenny Fairfield?
I can't understand a word of what has
passed. You don't mean to say that
good Lenny Fairfield (who was
absent from church by the bye) can
have done anything to get into disgrace?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he has though," cried the
Squire. "Stirn, I say&mdash;Stirn." But
Stirn had forced his way through the
hedge and vanished. Thus left to his
own powers of narrative at secondhand,
Mr Hazeldean now told all he
had to communicate: the assault upon
Randal Leslie, and the prompt punishment
inflicted by Stirn; his own indignation
at the affront to his young
kinsman, and his good-natured merciful
desire to save the culprit from
the addition of public humiliation.</p>

<p>The Parson, mollified towards the
rude and hasty invention of the beer-drinking,
took the Squire by the hand.
"Ah, Mr Hazeldean, forgive me," he
said repentantly; "I ought to have
known at once that it was only some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
ebullition of your heart that could
stifle your sense of decorum. But
this is a sad story about Lenny,
brawling and fighting on the Sabbath-day.
So unlike him, too&mdash;I don't
know what to make of it."</p>

<p>"Like or unlike," said the Squire,
"it has been a gross insult to young
Leslie; and looks all the worse because
I and Audley are not just the
best friends in the world. I can't
think what it is," continued Mr Hazeldean,
musingly, "but it seems that
there must be always some association
of fighting connected with that
prim half-brother of mine. There was
I, son of his own mother&mdash;who might
have been shot through the lungs,
only the ball lodged in the shoulder&mdash;and
now his wife's kinsman&mdash;my kinsman,
too&mdash;grandmother a Hazeldean&mdash;a
hard-reading sober lad, as I am
given to understand, can't set his foot
into the quietest parish in the three
kingdoms, but what the mildest boy
that ever was seen&mdash;makes a rush at
him like a mad bull. It is <span class="smcap">Fatality</span>!"
cried the Squire solemnly.</p>

<p>"Ancient legend records similar
instances of fatality in certain houses,"
observed Riccabocca. "There was
the House of Pelops&mdash;and Polynices
and Eteocles&mdash;the sons of [OE]dipus!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw," said the Parson; "but
what's to be done?"</p>

<p>"Done?" said the Squire; "why,
reparation must be made to young
Leslie. And though I wished to spare
Lenny, the young ruffian, a public disgrace&mdash;for
your sake, Parson Dale,
and Mrs Fairfield's;&mdash;yet a good caning
in private&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, sir!" said Riccabocca mildly,
"and hear me." The Italian then,
with much feeling and considerable
tact, pleaded the cause of his poor prot&eacute;g&eacute;,
and explained how Lenny's error
arose only from mistaken zeal for the
Squire's service, and in the execution
of the orders received from Mr
Stirn.</p>

<p>"That alters the matter," said the
Squire, softened; "and all that is
necessary now will be for him to make
a proper apology to my kinsman."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is just," rejoined the
Parson; "but I still don't learn how
he got out of the Stocks."</p>

<p>Riccabocca then resumed his tale;
and, after confessing his own principal
share in Lenny's escape, drew a moving
picture of the boy's shame and
honest mortification. "Let us march
against Philip!" cried the Athenians,
when they heard Demosthenes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us go at once and comfort the
child!" cried the Parson, before Riccabocca
could finish.</p>

<p>With that benevolent intention, all
three quickened their pace, and soon
arrived at the widow's cottage. But
Lenny had caught sight of their
approach through the window; and
not doubting that, in spite of Riccabocca's
intercession, the Parson was
come to upbraid, and the Squire to
re-imprison, he darted out by the
back way, got amongst the woods,
and lay there <i>perdu</i> all the evening.
Nay, it was not till after dark that his
mother&mdash;who sate wringing her hands
in the little kitchen, and trying in vain
to listen to the Parson and Mrs Dale,
who (after sending in search of the
fugitive) had kindly come to console
the mother&mdash;heard a timid knock at
the door and a nervous fumble at the
latch. She started up, opened the
door, and Lenny sprang to her bosom,
and there buried his face, sobbing
loud.</p>

<p>"No harm, my boy," said the Parson
tenderly; "you have nothing to
fear&mdash;all is explained and forgiven."</p>

<p>Lenny looked up, and the veins on
his forehead were much swollen.
"Sir," said he sturdily, "I don't want
to be forgiven&mdash;I ain't done no wrong.
And&mdash;I've been disgraced&mdash;and I
won't go to school, never no more."</p>

<p>"Hush, Carry!" said the Parson to
his wife, who, with the usual liveliness
of her little temper, was about
to expostulate. "Good night, Mrs
Fairfield. I shall come and talk to
you to-morrow, Lenny; by that time
you will think better of it."</p>

<p>The Parson then conducted his wife
home, and went up to the Hall to
report Lenny's safe return; for the
Squire was very uneasy about him,
and had even in person shared the
search. As soon as he heard Lenny
was safe&mdash;"Well," said the Squire,
"let him go the first thing in the
morning to Rood Hall, to ask Master
Leslie's pardon, and all will be right
and smooth again."</p>

<p>"A young villain!" cried Frank,
with his cheeks the colour of scarlet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
"to strike a gentleman and an Etonian,
who had just been to call on <i>me</i>!
But I wonder Randal let him off so
well&mdash;any other boy in the sixth
form would have killed him!"</p>

<p>"Frank," said the Parson sternly,
"if we all had our deserts, what should
be done to him who not only lets the
sun go down on his own wrath, but
strives with uncharitable breath to
fan the dying embers of another's?"</p>

<p>The clergyman here turned away
from Frank, who bit his lip, and
seemed abashed&mdash;while even his mother
said not a word in his exculpation;
for when the Parson did reprove
in that stern tone, the majesty of the
Hall stood awed before the rebuke of
the Church. Catching Riccabocca's
inquisitive eye, Mr Dale drew aside
the philosopher, and whispered to him
his fears that it would be a very hard
matter to induce Lenny to beg Randal
Leslie's pardon, and that the proud
stomach of the pattern-boy would not
digest the Stocks with as much ease
as a long regimen of philosophy had
enabled the sage to do. This conference
Miss Jemima soon interrupted
by a direct appeal to the Doctor
respecting the number of years (even
without any previous and more violent
incident) that the world could possibly
withstand its own wear and tear.</p>

<p>"Ma'am," said the Doctor, reluctantly
summoned away, to look at a
passage in some prophetic periodical
upon that interesting subject&mdash;"ma'am,
it is very hard that you
should make one remember the end
of the world, since, in conversing with
you, one's natural temptation is to
forget its existence."</p>

<p>Miss Jemima blushed scarlet. Certainly
that deceitful heartless compliment
justified all her contempt for
the male sex; and yet&mdash;such is human
blindness&mdash;it went far to redeem all
mankind in her credulous and too
confiding soul.</p>

<p>"He is about to propose," sighed
Miss Jemima.</p>

<p>"Giacomo," said Riccabocca, as he
drew on his nightcap, and stepped
majestically into the four-posted bed,
"I think we shall get that boy for the
garden now!"</p>

<p>Thus each spurred his hobby, or
drove her car, round the Hazeldean
whirligig.</p>

<p>Although history and biography
both relate to the affairs of men, and
are employed in the narrative of
human events, they are governed by
opposite principles, and require, for
their successful prosecution, different
powers and habits of thought. The
main object of history is the tracing
out the growth of nations, the great
events which lead to their rise or fall,
the causes operating on the social
body, which at one period conduct to
power and greatness, at another induce
weakness and decay. Biography is
concerned with individual life. Its
aim is to trace the annals, not of
nations, but of persons; to portray,
not the working of general causes on
the progress of empires, but the influence
of particular characters on
their most interesting episodes. The
former requires habits of general
thought, and the power of tracing one
common principle through a great
variety of complicated details; the
latter, close attention to individual
incidents, and a minute examination
of the secret springs of human conduct.
The first is closely allied to
the generalisations of the philosopher;
the latter requires the powers of the
dramatist. The two branches of composition,
however, are nearly allied,
and frequently run into each other.
History generally finds its most interesting
episodes, often its most important
subjects, in the narrative of
individual greatness; biography is
imperfect unless, in addition to tracing
the achievements of the individuals it
records, it explains their influence upon
the society among whom they arose.</p>

<p>What we call the histories of antiquity
were, for the most part, only
biographies, and they owe their principal
interest to that circumstance.
The <i>Cyrop&aelig;dia</i> of Xenophon is a philosophical
romance, clothed with the
eloquence of an orator; the fragments
which remain of Sallust, the rhetorical
narrative of Quintus Curtius, are the
avowed biographies of individual men.
Even the regular histories of classical
times owe their chief charm to the
simplicity of the subject, in which one
state or contest stands prominently
forward, and the others are thrown
into a shade which only renders the
more striking the light thrown on one
particular subject, or the efforts of
individual greatness. Herodotus has
earned his deathless fame by the narrative
he has given of the great war
between Persia and Greece, on which
the destinies of mankind depended;
Thucydides by his profound exposition
of the strife of aristocracy and
democracy in the contest between
Laced&aelig;mon and Athens. The long
narrative of Livy has survived the
floods of Time almost entirely from
the charming episodes descriptive of
character or manners which he has
introduced, and the dramatic power
with which he has narrated the exploits
of individual men; and what
has given Tacitus immortality, is
neither any luminous views on the
progress of mankind, nor any just
appreciation of the causes of greatness
in particular states, but the depth to
which he has fathomed the real springs
of action in particular men, and the
terrible truth with which he has unveiled
that most appalling of all spectacles&mdash;a
naked human heart.</p>

<p>The great difficulty of history, as it
must be written in modern times,
arises from the multitude and complication
of the events which have to be
recorded. So intimately connected
have the States of Europe been since
the rise of modern civilisation, that he
who writes the annals of one must
write the history of all. The progress,
internal and external, of all its powers
must be brought forward abreast; and
such is their number and importance,
that not only is the historian oppressed
with the variety and complication of
his materials, but he finds it next to
impossible to produce interest in the
reader amidst such a sea of details;
and often fails, from the impossibility
of attaining that essential requisite in
the rousing of human sympathy&mdash;unity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>of emotion. Add to this the
infinity of subjects a historian even of
an individual state must now embrace,
and which almost overwhelm the
exploits of particular men by their
multitude and complication. Strategy,
statistics, trade, navigation, commerce,
agriculture, taxation, finance,
currency, paper credit, poor laws,
agriculture, socialism, chartism, form
a few of the topics, any one of which
would require volumes for its elucidation,
yet none of which can be
omitted without exposing the historian
to the imputation, from some
one or other, of having overlooked
the most important part of his
subject. So great is this difficulty,
so extensive the embarrassment it
produces, that it may safely be pronounced
to be insurmountable by
any effort, how great soever, unless
the endeavours of the historian are
aided by unity of interest in the subject,
or overpowering greatness of
influence in the characters with whom
he has to deal. But it is, perhaps,
only in the wars of the Crusades, of
the Succession in Spain, and of the
French Revolution, that such unity of
interest is to be looked for, or such
surpassing grandeur of character is
to be found, from the achievements
of a Richard C&oelig;ur-de-Lion, a Marlborough,
or a Napoleon.</p>

<p>From this great difficulty, biography
is entirely free, and thence
the superior interest with which, when
properly treated, works of that description
are attended. We are so
constituted that we must concentrate
our interest; dispersion is fatal to its
existence. Every novelist and romance-writer
knows this; there must
always be a hero and a heroine; but
two or three heroes and heroines
would prove fatal to the interest.
Ariosto tried to divide the interest of
the reader among the adventures of a
dozen knights-errant; but even his
genius proved unequal to the task,
and he was obliged to concentrate the
whole around the fabulous siege of
Paris to restore the broken unity of
his power. The great and signal
advantage of biography is, that, from
its very nature, it possesses that personal
interest and individual character
which the epic poet and novelist
feel to be essential to the moving of
the human heart, but which the historian
so often finds himself unable to
attain, without omitting some important
parts of his subject, or giving
undue prominence to the characters
of individual men.</p>

<p>For this reason it is, that the
most popular works which ever have
been written have been biographies
of illustrious men. No one would
think of comparing the intellect of
Plutarch to that of Tacitus, his
eloquence to that of Cicero's, yet he
has made perhaps a greater impression
on the imagination of subsequent
ages than either of these illustrious
men. If we examine the
images of the mighty of former days
which are engraven on our minds, we
shall find that it is not so much the
pictured pages of Livy or Quintus
Curtius, as the "Lives of Plutarch,"
which have given them immortality.
We complain of his gossip, we lament
his superstition, we smile at his
credulity, but we devour his pages;
and, after the lapse of seventeen hundred
years, they remain one of the
most generally popular works in existence.
It is the same in modern
times. No one would think of comparing
Boswell, in point of intellect,
to Johnson; in point of eloquence to
Burke; in point of genius to Gibbon;
yet he has produced a work superior
in general interest to any of these
illustrious men, and which is daily
read by thousands, to whom the
"Reflections on the French Revolution,"
the moral essays of the
"Rambler," and the "History of the
Decline and Fall," will for ever
remain unknown.</p>

<p>To render biography, however, thus
generally attractive, it is indispensable
that its basis should be that
first element in the narration of
human action&mdash;<span class="smcap">Truth</span>. Without
this, it wants the great superiority of
the narrative of real event over fictitious
creations, how interesting soever
they may be&mdash;that of recording what
has actually occurred in real life.
How important an element this is in
awakening the sympathies of the
human heart, may be seen even in
children who, when particularly fascinated
by any story they are told,
invariably end by asking, "But is it
all true?" The value of truth, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
rather of what is "<i>vraisemblable</i>," is
felt even in imaginary conceptions,
which it is well known are never so
attractive, or interest so powerfully,
as when they most closely resemble
the events and characters of actual
existence. The real is, and ever
must be, the only sure foundation of
the ideal. Novels are most delightful
when they approach nearest to
what we behold around us in real
life, while yet containing a sufficient
blending of romance and sentiment,
of heroism and magnanimity, to
satisfy the higher aspirations of our
being. Biography is most charming
when it depicts with fidelity those
characters, and records with truth
those events, which approach nearest
to that imaginary perfection to which
every generous mind aspires, but to
which none ever has attained, or
ever will.</p>

<p>It has been said with truth, that
the events which are suitable for epic
poetry are such as are "probable but
yet elevating." We are so constituted
by our bonds to earth, that our chief
interest must ever be derived from the
virtues or the vices, the joys or sorrows,
of beings like ourselves; but we are so
filled with more ennobling thoughts and
aspirations, by our destiny in Heaven,
that we can be satisfied only by what
points to a higher state of existence,
and feel the greatest enjoyment by
being elevated, either by the conceptions
of fancy or the records of reality,
to a nearer view of its perfection.
If novels depict merely imaginary
existences, they may charm for a
season, like the knights of Ariosto, or
the heroes of Metastasio; but they
are too much in the clouds permanently
to interest sublunary mortals.
If they record merely the adventures
of low, or the vulgarity of middle
life, they may amuse for a season,
like the characters of Smollett; but
they will sink ere long, from the
want of that indispensable lifeboat
in the sea of time, an elevating tendency.
It is characters like those of
the <i>Iliad</i>, of Shakspeare, of Scott,
and Schiller, which combine the well-known
and oft-observed characteristics
of human nature with the oft-imagined
but seldom seen traits of
heroism and magnanimity which
border on the realms of the ideal
that for ever fascinate the imagination,
and dwell in the heart of man.
The reason is, they contain enough of
reality to tell us it is of humanity
that the story is told, and enough of
the ideal to make us proud of our
connection with it.</p>

<p>The great and chief charm of biography
is to be found in this, that
it unites, from its very nature and
object, those two indispensable requisites
to durable popularity in works
of fiction, and combines them with
the value and the solid information of
truthful narrative. It possesses the
value of history, without its tedium&mdash;the
interest of romance, without its
unsubstantiality. It culls the flowers
from the records of time, and casts
into the shade all the accompanying
weeds and briars. If a judicious and
discriminating selection of characters
were made&mdash;if those persons were
selected for the narrative who have
been most illustrious by their virtues,
their genius, or their magnanimity,
or, as a contrast, by their vices, and
who have made the greatest and
most durable impression on human
affairs, a work might be produced
exceeding any one of history in its utility,
any of romance in its popularity.
David Hume strongly advised Robertson,
eighty years ago, instead of
writing the <i>Life of Charles the Fifth</i>,
to write a series of biographies, on the
plan of Plutarch, for modern times;
and it is, perhaps, to be regretted
that the advice was not followed.
Yet were the abilities of the Scotch
Principal, great as they were, not
such as peculiarly fitted him for the
task. His mind was too philosophical
and discursive to give it its chief interest.
He wanted the dramatic turn,
the ardent soul, the graphic power,
the magnanimous disposition, which
was essential to its successful accomplishment.
A work in three thousand
pages, or six volumes, recording the
lives of fifty of the greatest and most
illustrious men in Europe, from the
days of Alfred to those of Napoleon,
executed in the right spirit, and by a
man of adequate genius, would be the
most popular and elevating book that
ever appeared in Modern Europe.
Many such have been attempted, but
never with any success, because they
were not set about by the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
minds. To do justice to such an undertaking
would require a combination
of opposite qualities rarely to
be met with in real life.</p>

<p>As biography deals with individual
characters, and is relieved
from the extended and perplexing
subjects which overwhelm the general
historian, it admits, in return, of an
expansion into many topics which,
although often in the highest degree
amusing, and sometimes not a little
interesting, would yet be felt to be
misplaced in the annals of the great
changes of nations or of the world.
As the delineation of character is its
avowed object, and the events of individual
life its principal subject, it
not only admits of but requires a
thousand incidents and descriptions,
which are essential to a right understanding
of those characters, and
form, as it were, the still life of the
picture in which their features are to
be portrayed. Such descriptions are
not unsuitable to general history. Mr
Macaulay has shown in his History
that his observations on that head in
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> were founded
on a just appreciation of the object
and limits of his art. But they must
be sparingly introduced, or they will
become tedious and unprofitable: if
any one doubts this, let him <i>try</i> to
read Von Hammer's <i>History of the
Ottoman Empire</i>, one-half of which is
taken up with descriptions of dresses,
receptions, and processions. But in
biography we readily give admission
to&mdash;nay, we positively require&mdash;such
details. If they are not the jewels of
history, they are the setting which
adds to their lustre. They fill up our
conception of past events; they enable
us to clothe the characters in
which we are interested in the actual
habiliments in which they were arrayed;
they bring before our eyes the
dwellings, the habits, the mode of
life, the travelling, the occupations of
distant ages, and often give more life
and reality to the creatures of our
imaginations than could have been
attained by the most laboured general
descriptions, or the most emphatic
assertions of the author.</p>

<p>For this reason, as well as on account
of the known influence of individual
character, rather than abstract
principle, on the fair sex, there is no
branch of historical composition so
suitable for woman as biography;
and Miss Strickland has shown us
that there is none which female genius
can cultivate with greater success.
The general bent of the female
mind, impressed upon it for the wisest
purposes by its Creator, is to be influenced
in its opinions, and swayed
in its conduct, by individual men,
rather than general ideas. When
Milton said of our first parents&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For valour he and contemplation formed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For beauty she, and sweet attractive grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He for God only, she for God in him</i>;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He foreshadowed man as the appropriate
historian of the general march
of human events&mdash;woman, as the
best delineator of individual character,
the most fascinating writer of
biography. The most gifted of her
sex is a proof of this; for if a few
men have exceeded Madame de Stael
in the broad view she takes of human
affairs, none have equalled her in the
delineation of the deepest feelings
and most lasting passions of the
human heart. As it is the nature
of woman's disposition to form an
idol, (and it is for that very reason
that she proves so attractive to
that of man,) so, when she comes
to composition, we rejoice to see her
form idols of her heroes, provided
only that the limits of truth are
observed in their delineation, and that
her enthusiasm is evinced in depicting
the real, not in colouring the imaginary.</p>

<p>As graphic and scenic details are so
valuable in biography, and give such
life and animation to the picture which
it exhibits, so we willingly accept from
a female biographer, whether of her
own or others' life, details which we
could not tolerate in the other sex.
When the Duchess of Abrantes, writing
after the fall of Charles X., recounts
in her charming memoirs the enchanting
<i>Schall de Cachemire</i>, which excited
her envy on the shoulders of Josephine&mdash;or
tells us that at a certain ball in
Paris, in 1797, she wore her blue satin
dress and pearl ornaments, and at
another, her pink silk, and diamonds,
we perhaps smile at the simplicity
which made her recount such things
of herself; but still we gratefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
accept them as characteristic of the
costume or manners of the time. But
we would never tolerate a male biographer
of Murat, who should tell us
that at a certain ball at Naples he wore
his scarlet trowsers and black furred
jacket, and on his coronation looked
irresistible in his blue and silver uniform
and splendid spare jacket;&mdash;not
even though we know that in Russia
he often returned to his lines with his
sabre dripping wet with the blood of
the Cossacks whom he had challenged
and slain in single combat, and although
the experience of all ages has
confirmed the truth of Philop&oelig;men's
observation, that "to soldiers and
women, dress is a matter of no small
consequence."</p>

<p>Though details of this description,
however, are valuable and admissible
in biography, and come with peculiar
propriety and grace from a female
hand, it must be observed, on the
other hand, that there is a limit,
and a very obvious one, to the introduction
of them, and that, if not inserted
with caution, they may essentially
injure the popularity or utility
of a work. In particular, it is seldom
safe to carry to any considerable length
in the text the introduction of quotations
from old histories or chronicles
of the period, which often are filled with
them to the exclusion of all other subjects.
We know that such original
documents have a great charm in
the eyes of antiquarians or antiquarian
biographers, the more especially if they
have brought them to light themselves;
but such persons learned in
ancient lore constitute but a small
fraction of the human race. The great
body of readers, at least nineteen out
of twenty, care nothing at all for such
original authorities, but wish to see their
import condensed into a flowing easy
narrative in the author's own words.
For this reason it is generally safest
to give such original documents or
quotations in notes or an appendix,
and to confine quotations in the text
to characteristic expressions, or original
words spoken on very important occasions.
Barante and Sismondi in France,
Tytler in Scotland, and Lingard
in England, have essentially injured
the general popularity of their great
and learned works, by not attending
to this rule. The two Thierrys
have chiefly won theirs by attending
to it.</p>

<p>The great popularity and widely
extended sale of Miss Strickland's
<i>Queens of England</i>, almost equalling,
we believe, that of any living author
in this country, and much exceeding
that of any prior writer, whether of
her own or the other sex, in the same
period in biography, is a proof both of
the intrinsic excellence of that work,
and the thirst which exists in the
public mind for works of that description.
We have long been of opinion
that the narrative of human events
might be rendered as popular in the
outset, and far more and durably interesting
in the end, than any works of
fiction; and that the only reason why
this has so seldom taken place, was
because historical works were in general
constructed on wrong principles.
The great success which has recently
attended historical composition in this
country, especially in the case of Mr
Macaulay's History and Miss Strickland's
Lives, is a proof that this view
of the subject is well founded. And of
the two, biography, when supported by
learning, and handled by genius such
as both these learned writers possess,
is much more likely to be generally
popular than extended history, because
it partakes more of the character
of Romance, and possesses in a higher
degree that <i>unity</i> of interest which is
the most essential element in all arts
which aim at pleasing or fascinating
mankind.</p>

<p>Scotland is a country peculiarly
fortunate in the characters it presents
for biographical genius. This
arises from its physical weakness
when compared to the strength of its
formidable neighbour, and the resources
which it has ever found in the
persevering and indomitable character
of its inhabitants. The former in every
age of the wars with England has
made its plains the seat of conflict;
while the latter has always secured
their success in the end, though often
after fearful reverses, and always
against tremendous odds. The proof
of this is decisive. Scotland, after
three centuries of almost incessant
conflict, first with the arms, and then,
more formidable still, with the gold
of England, was still unsubdued when
her monarchs ascended the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
throne, and the rivalry of two noble
nations was turned into the blissful
emulation of peace. It is this combination
of circumstances which has caused
her history to be so prolific of incident,
and has rendered, as strangers so
often have remarked, every step in
her surface historical. Her physical
weakness filled it with incident&mdash;her
moral strength with heroic incident.
Go where you will, you meet with
some traces of the great or the beautiful,
the gifted or the fascinating, of
former days. The ancient walls and
castellated rocks of Edinburgh teem
with historical recollections of the
highest interest, which the kindred
spirit of modern chivalry has done
so much to illustrate.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In the short
space of twenty miles&mdash;between
Falkirk and Stirling&mdash;are four battlefields,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
on each of which the fate of
Britain was determined, or armies
as numerous as those which met at
Waterloo encountered each other.
Lochleven exhibits the mournful prison
of beauty: Niddry Castle, of her
evanescent joys; the field of Langside,
of her final overthrow. Cartlan
Crags still show the cave of Wallace;
Turnberry Castle the scene of Bruce's
first victory; Culloden, the last battle-field
of generous fidelity. Every step
in Scotland is historical: the shades
of the dead arise on every side: the very
rocks breathe&mdash;</p>

<p>Miss Strickland's talents as a
writer, and turn of mind as an individual,
in a peculiar manner fit
her for painting a historical gallery
of the most illustrious or dignified
female characters in that land of
chivalry and of song. Her disposition
is at once heroic and pictorial.
She has the spirit of chivalry in her
soul, and the colours of painting in
her eye. She sympathises with all
the daring spirit, the bold adventure,
the chivalrous devotion, of the cavaliers
of former days; and she depicts
with not less animation and force
the stately scenes of departed times&mdash;the
dignified processions, the splendid
ceremonials, the imposing pageants.
She has vast powers of application,
and her research is unbounded; but
these qualities, so necessary as the
foundation of a historian's fame, are
in her united with the powers of painting
and the soul of poetry, and dignified
by the elevated objects to which
they are directed. The incidents of
individual life are of peculiar importance
in Scottish annals, because,
with the exception of two periods&mdash;the
war of independence under Wallace
and Bruce, and the national
struggle for emancipation from Popish
tyranny at the Reformation&mdash;there
have seldom been what we now
call <i>popular</i> movements in Scotland.
Everything, or next to everything,
depended on individual character; the
great game of the world was played by
kings and queens, nobles and knights.
On this great theatre the queens
played, as they do everywhere, a most
important part. The instruction of man
in childhood, the object of his adoration
in youth, of lasting influence in
manhood, woman has, in modern
Europe where her destiny was first
fully developed, exercised an important
sway, and more so than is
generally supposed on national affairs.
But nowhere has this influence been
more strongly felt than in Scotland,
where queens have appeared, whose
beauty and misfortunes have become
immortal in story, and been for ever
engraven on the human heart by
the hand of genius, and where the
chivalrous and daring disposition of
the country, the <i>perfervidum Scotorum
ingenium</i>, at once penetrated some
with the most devout adoration of
their charms, and inspired others
with the most vehement jealousy of
their ascendency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>In her delineation of individual
character, Miss Strickland evidently
takes the greatest pains to be impartial;
and the multitude of new documents
and facts which she has brought
on both sides of the question in regard
to her heroines, is a sufficient proof
that this most laudable principle is a
ruling one in her mind. But she
would be something more or something
less than mortal, if no trace of
predilection was to be found in her
pages. It is rather, however, in regard
to families than individuals that this
leaning is apparent. She is evidently
inimical to the Tudor and friendly to
the Stuart race. In this she only
shares the feelings of the chivalrous
and the enthusiastic of every age and
country; for the leading qualities of
the one were as calculated, on a retrospect,
to inspire aversion as those
of the other were to awaken sympathy.
The first was selfish, overbearing,
cruel, but often exceedingly able:
the latter generous, unsuspecting,
heroic, but sometimes sadly imprudent.
Success at the time crowned
the worldly wisdom of the one, and
disaster, long-continued and crushing,
at length punished the unhappy want
of foresight of the other. But the
results of the time are not always indicative
of the opinion of futurity:
and already the verdict of mankind
has been secured in regard to the
rival Queens who brought their fortunes
into collision, by two pleaders of
surpassing power in swaying the human
heart. Scotland may be proud
that one of these was found in the
most gifted of her sons, whose genius
has, in one of his most perfect historical
novels, immortalised the prison of
Lochleven and the field of Langside;
and Germany may well exult in the
reflection that the other appeared in
that matchless genius who three centuries
after her death imbibed, on the
banks of the Saale, the very soul and
spirit of the age of Mary in England,
and has for ever engraven her heroic
death, and the imperishable scenes of
Fotheringay, on the hearts of men.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Miss Strickland's partiality for the
Stuart and aversion to the Tudor
race, may be explained by another
and still more honourable circumstance.
It is the inevitable effect of
a long course of injustice, whether in
the rulers of men, or the judges of
those rulers, the annalists of their
lives, to produce in the end a reaction
in the general mind. This is more
particularly the case in persons like
Miss Strickland, actuated by generous
and elevated feelings, and who
feel conscious of power to redress
much of the injustice which the long-continued
ascendency of a particular
party, whether in religion or politics,
has inflicted on the characters of History.
Nowhere has this injustice
been more strongly experienced than
in Great Britain during the last two
centuries. The popular party in
politics, and the reformed in religion,
having in both these countries, after
a sanguinary struggle, been successful,
and a family seated on the throne
which embodied, and in a manner
personified, both these triumphs,
nearly the whole historians who
treated of the period for a century
and a half were entirely one-sided.
When Hume wrote his immortal history,
he complained, with justice, that
for seventy years power, reward, and
emolument had been confined to one
party in the state, and that the
sources of History had in consequence
been irremediably corrupted. His
rhetorical powers and impartial spirit
did much to remedy the evil, but he
had not industry and research sufficient
to do the whole. Much was
left to the just feelings, and generous
because disinterested effort, of the
high-minded who succeeded him in
the path of historical inquiry. Mr
Tytler's great and authentic <i>History
of Scotland</i>, and Lingard's able and
valuable, though one-sided, <i>History
of England</i>, have gone far to give
the opposite side of the picture
which Malcolm Laing and Burnet had
painted in so vehement a party spirit,
and Macaulay has since continued
with such remarkable historical power.
But much remained yet to be done.
Antiquarian industry, chivalrous zeal,
have of late brought many of the concealed
or suppressed treasures of History
to light; and it is those which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Miss Strickland proposes to embody
in her <i>Queens of Scotland</i>.</p>

<p>Of the general plan which she proposes
to adopt in this work, our
author gives the following admirable
account:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As long as Scotland, in consequence
of bad roads and tedious travelling, remained
a sort of <i>terra incognita</i>, vulgar
prejudice prevailed among the ignorant
and narrow-minded portion of society in
England; but Scotland only required to
be seen to be appreciated. Strong in
native talent, rich in native worth, valiant,
persevering, and wise, her sons have been
ever foremost in the field of honourable
enterprise, whether in deeds of arms,
science, jurisprudence, or the industrial
arts of peaceful life. In poetry, music,
and song, she has certainly never been
surpassed. It was, however, reserved
for the genius of Sir Walter Scott to draw
English hearts and English gold to Scotland,
and to knit those bonds of brotherly
regard which no act of legislature could
do. His graphic pictures of Scotland and
the Scotch acted like a spell of enchantment
on the imaginations of the English.
Those who were able to indulge the
enthusiastic feelings which his writings
had excited, crossed the Border, rushed
into Highland glens, scaled Highland
hills, congregated at Scotch hostelries,
peeped into Scotch cottages, were invited
to partake of Scotch hospitality&mdash;and
found themselves in a land flowing with
milk and honey, not merely in its festive
character, but in its kindliness to strangers,
which is the glory of all lands.</p>

<p>"Yet among the numerous visitors
whom the sight-seeing instincts of this
age of locomotion have rendered familiar
with the ancient seats of Scottish regality,
how few know anything about the
Queens who once held their courts within
the now deserted walls of Dunfermline,
Falkland, Linlithgow, and Stirling!&mdash;gems
which, even in their desolation, are
surviving monuments of the graceful
tastes of their founders, and incline the
musing antiquary, who realises in fancy
for a moment their pristine glory, to
smite his breast and exclaim 'Ichabod!'
With the exception of Windsor Castle,
England has certainly no vestige of palatial
architecture which may compare
with the royal homes of Scotland, of whose
former tenants a few particulars may be
no less acceptable to the sons and daughters
of the land, than to the southern
stranger who visits them.</p>

<p>"The Maiden Castle, sitting enthroned
on her dun rock, the Acropolis of Edinburgh,
at once a relic and a witness of
the immutable Past, is full of memories
of eventful scenes connected with Queens
whose hearts would have leaped with
exultation could their eyes have looked
on such a vision of national prosperity as
the bright New Town, with its gay streets,
and shops full of costly merchandise; its
spacious squares, crescents, and noble
public buildings, rising on the outer
<i>ballium</i> of that grim fortress whose base
is now surrounded by green flowery gardens,
for the joyance of a peace-loving
generation. Mons Meg and her brethren
have lost their vocation through the
amended temper of the times, and hold
sinecure posts in silence&mdash;their destructive
thunders being superseded by the
din of the railway trains bringing hourly
freights of wealth and wisdom to the
good town of Edinburgh and its inhabitants.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Many original royal letters will be embodied
in these volumes, with facts and
anecdotes carefully verified. Local traditions,
not unworthy of attention, have been
gathered in the desolate palaces and historic
sites where every peasant is an oral
chronicler, full of spirit-stirring recollections
of the past. These are occasionally
connected with themes which were the
fountains whence Sir Walter Scott drew his
inspiration for the chivalric poetry and romance
which has rendered Scotland classic
ground. The tastes of those who were
the rising generation, when the Waverley
romances were the absorbing theme of
interest in the literary world, have become
matured. They require to have
history rendered as agreeable without
the mixture of fiction as with it; they
desire to have it so written, without sacrificing
truth to fastidiousness, that they
may read it with their children, and that
the whole family party shall be eager to
resume the book when they gather round
the work-table during the long winter
evenings.</p>

<p>"Authors who feel as they ought to
feel, should rejoice in seeing their productions
capable of imparting pleasure to
the simple as well as the refined; for a
book which pleases only one grade of
society may be fashionable, but cannot be
called popular. That which interests
peasants as well as peers, and is read
with equal zest by children and parents,
and is often seen in the hands of the
operative classes, speaks to the heart in a
language intelligible to a widely-extended
circle of humanity, has written its own
review, and needs no other."</p></div>

<p>In the last lines of these admirable
observations, we doubt not Miss Strickland
has, without intending it, foreshadowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the destiny of her own
undertaking.</p>

<p>The work begins with the Life of
Margaret Tudor, daughter of Henry
VII. of England, and married at the
early age of fourteen to James IV.,
the heroic and brilliant King of Scotland.
This choice, in many respects,
was fortunate, as it commences with
the period when the fortunes of the
two kingdoms became closely interlaced,
and with the princess whose
marriage with James was the immediate
cause of the union of the two
crowns on the same head, and the
placing of the Stuart, and through it
of the Hanoverian family, on the
British throne.</p>

<p>The first chapter is occupied with
the details of the journey of the royal
bride from London to Edinburgh,
which was somewhat a more tedious
and fatiguing undertaking than it is
now when performed by her descendant
Queen Victoria, for it took above
<i>three weeks</i> to perform. The reception
of the youthful princess at York,
Newcastle, and Durham, where she
was met and attended by the whole
nobility and gentry of the northern
counties, who accompanied her on her
progress northward on horseback,
gives occasion for several faithful and
animated pictures. Her first day's
journey in Scotland, however, brought
her into ruder scenery, characteristic
of the stormy life which lay before
her; and she rested the first night at
<i>Fastcastle</i>, then a stronghold of the
Home family, now belonging to Sir
John Hall of Dunglass, which modern
genius, under a feigned name, has
done so much to celebrate.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Fastcastle is no other than the veritable
Wolf-Crag Tower, celebrated in
Scott's <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i> as the
abode of the Master of Ravenswood. It
is seated on a lofty promontory, which
commands the lonely indented bay of
which St Abb's Head forms the extreme
point to the right, with a wild array of
rifted rocks terminating in the Wolf-Crag,
which soars high in mid air above
the fortress&mdash;black, gloomy, and inaccessible.
The way by which the southern
bride and her company reached this
rugged resting-place lay across the Lammermuir,
several miles of wild heath and
treacherous bog, which no stranger might
traverse in safety without guides well
acquainted with the track. Before they
entered on this pass, they had to descend
a hill which was so steep and precipitous
that, even within the last century, it was
customary for the passengers by the
mail-coach between Berwick and Edinburgh
to alight and cross it on foot, while
the carriage was taken off the wheels and
carried over by a relay of men, stationed
on the spot for that purpose. Of course
the roads were not better in the beginning
of the sixteenth century. Fastcastle is
approached by one or two descents and
ascents of this kind, and is separated from
the mainland by a cleft between the
rocks, which has to be crossed by a natural
bridge formed of a ledge of rock, without
rail or guard, with the vexed billows
boiling and thundering sixty feet below.</p>

<p>"When the young Tudor Queen made
her passage across this Al Arat of the
Caledonian coast, she had the German
Ocean before her, which beats against
the rocky battlements and defences with
which the basement of the castle is surrounded.
One of these masses resembles
the upturned keel of a huge man-of-war
stranded among other fragments,
which, like the relics of a former world,
lay scattered at the foot of the precipice,
with the wild breakers rushing through
their clefts, forming a grand <i>jet-d'eau</i>,
and tossing the light feathery foam on
high. The larger rocks are the haunt of
innumerable sea-birds. Fastcastle had
formerly been the stronghold of some of
those ferocious feudal pirates who may
be regarded as the buccaneers of the
Caledonian coast. Many a bloody deed
had been perpetrated within its isolated
and inaccessible circuit; but the festive
solemnities and ceremonials that surrounded
the royal bride allowed no
leisure or opportunity for whispers of the
dark tales and romantic traditions connected
with its history."</p></div>

<p>Hitherto the Tudor princess had
not seen her royal lover. Their first
interview, and his personal appearance,
are described in these characteristic
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"James entered the presence of Margaret
Tudor with his hawking-lure flung
over his shoulder, dressed simply in a
velvet jacket; his hair and beard, curling
naturally, were rather long, his complexion
glowing from the manly exercise
he had just been engaged in. He was the
handsomest sovereign in Europe, the black
eyes and hair of his elegant father, James
III., being softened in his resemblance to
the blonde beauty of his Danish mother.
Sir Walter Scott has drawn James IV.'s
portrait <i>con amore</i>, and has not exaggerated
the likeness&mdash;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For hazel was his eagle eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And auburn of the darkest dye<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His short curled beard and hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light was his footstep in the dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And firm his stirrup in the lists,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oh, he had that merry glance<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which seldom lady's heart resists.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The young Queen met her royal lord at
the doorway of her great chamber. The
King of Scotland uncovered his head and
made a deep obeisance to her, while she
made a lowly reverence to him. He then
took her hand and kissed her, and saluted
all her ladies by kissing them. It was
noticed that he welcomed the chivalric
Earl of Surrey with especial cordiality.</p>

<p>"Then the King of Scotland took the
Queen on one side, and they communed
together for a long space. She <i>held good
manner</i>, [was unembarrassed;] and the
King remained bare-headed during the
time they conversed, and many courtesies
passed between them. <i>Incontinent</i> [immediately]
the board was set and served.
The King and Queen washed their hands
with humble reverence, and after that set
them down at table together."</p></div>

<p>The entry of the royal pair into
Edinburgh is thus described; and it
seems to have been attended with
one remarkable and characteristic
circumstance, for she <i>rode behind her
destined husband on the same horse</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Half way to Edinburgh, James IV.
was seen advancing with his company.
He was this time attired in grand costume.
'His steed was trapped with
gold, and round its neck was a deep gold
fringe; the saddle and harness were of
gold, but the bridle and head-gear of
burnished silver. The King wore a
jacket of cloth of gold, lined and bordered
with violet velvet and fine black
<i>bouge</i> or <i>budge</i> fur; his waistcoat was of
violet satin, his <i>hoses</i> of scarlet, his shirt
confined with bands of pearl and rich
stones; his spurs were long and gilt.
He rode towards the Queen in full
course, at the pace at which the hare is
hunted. On seeing her, he made very
humble obeisance, and, leaping down
from his horse, he came and kissed her
in her litter. Then mounting in his usual
gallant fashion, without touching stirrup,
a gentleman-usher unsheathed the sword
of state, and bore it before his King in
regal fashion. The Scottish sword was
enclosed in a scabbard of purple velvet,
whereon was written, in letters of pearl,
<i>God my defende</i>. The like words are on
the pommel, the cross, and the <i>chap</i> also.
The Earl of Bothwell bore this sword
when the royal party reached Edinburgh
town.'</p>

<p>"The King placed himself by the
Queen's litter, and passed all the time
conversing with her and entertaining her,
as he rode by her side.</p>

<p>"'Before they entered Edinburgh, one
of the King's gentlemen brought out a
fair courser, trapped in cloth of gold,
with crimson velvet, interlaced with
white and red: the King went to the
horse, mounted him without touching the
stirrup in the presence of the whole company,
then tried his paces&mdash;choosing to
judge himself whether it were safe for his
bride to ride on a pillion behind him,
which was the mode in which he intended
to enter the city.' Likewise he
caused one of his gentlemen to mount
behind him, as a lady would ride, to see
whether the proud courser would submit
to bear double or not.</p>

<p>"When he had concluded all his experiments,
he decided that it was not proper
to trust the safety of his bride to his
favourite charger; 'so King James dismounted
from him, and condescended to
ride on the Queen's gentle palfrey. He
mounted, and the Queen was placed on
a pillion behind him.'"</p></div>

<p>The real tragedy and most interesting
period of Margaret Tudor's life, is
that which preceded and followed the
fatal expedition to Flodden, to which
the genius of Mr Aytoun has lately
added such additional interest in his
exquisite ballads. Miss Strickland has
also been strongly moved by the same
catastrophe.&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There are traditions still current in
the neighbourhood of the beautiful palatial
ruin of Linlithgow relative to her
parting with James IV.</p>

<p>"Near the King's bed-chamber, and a
beautiful little apartment overlooking the
lake, supposed to be his dressing-room, is
a turnpike stair, at the corner of the east
side of the quadrangle erected by James
IV. This leads to a lofty turret or mirador,
called by popular tradition 'Queen
Margaret's Bower.' It is surrounded by
a stone bench or divan, and had once a
small stone table in the centre. Here
the Queen spent in tears the live-long
summer's day on which her husband left
her to march against England. Here,
too, she is said to have passed 'the
weary night of Flodden fight,' expecting
news of the engagement, which came at
last, but too soon.</p>

<p>"The fatal field of Flodden not only
made Queen Margaret a widow, but rendered
Scotland desolate and almost desperate.
All the hope that remained to
the people of averting the fury of Henry
VIII., and the cruelty of his successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
general, centred solely in the Queen&mdash;being
founded on the near relationship of
herself and their infant King to the
southern sovereign."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The Queen convened such of the nobility
as survived the red field of Flodden
to meet the clergy at Perth immediately.
So prompt were all their proceedings,
that the young King was crowned at
Scone, near that city, within twenty
days of his father's death. It was called
the Mourning Coronation; for the ancient
crown of Scotland being held over on the
baby-brow of the royal infant, most of
the witnesses and assistants of the ceremony
burst into an 'infectious passion'
of sobs and tears. They wept not only
their own recent losses on the battle-field,
but their late monarch, 'who was,' as
Buchanan says, albeit no commender of
kings, 'dear to all men while living, and
mightily lamented by his people at his
death.'</p>

<p>"When the first agony of grief was
abated at the loss of the King and the
terrible slaughter of the best of the nobility
and gentry who fought in the serried
phalanx of spears about his person, the
discovery was made by the Scottish
people that no other injury was like to
accrue from Flodden fight. It was, to
all intents and purposes, one of those
bad expenditures of human life called a
drawn battle. Had it taken place on
Scottish ground, it would have been
reckoned another Bannockburn: the
English must have retreated, (for they
did so on their own ground,) and the
Scots would have retained possession of
the field. As it was, the English had the
moral advantages of being an invaded
people; and, as such, their success in
making a great slaughter of those who
were arrayed in battle on their soil, redounded
more to their true glory than is
the case in most great victories. But they
did not purchase it easily. Stark and
stiff as James IV. lay under heaps of
slain, he kept possession of that well-stricken
field. The despatch of Lord
Dacre clearly proves that when the English
left the field at nightfall, they were
ignorant to whom the victory belonged.
Then the Homes and other Border chieftains
plundered the dead at their leisure;
their countrymen strongly suspected that
they slew their King, and turned the
scale of victory against their countrymen.
There is the more probability in
this supposition when it is remembered
how inflexibly James IV. had maintained
justice on his Borders&mdash;therefore he had
honestly won the enmity of those rapacious
septs.</p>

<p>"Lord Dacre made an excursion of
observation, with a party of cavalry, in
the morning after the battle of Flodden,
to ascertain who possessed the field; he
saw the King of Scotland's formidable
train of brass cannon dominant over the
scene, but mute and motionless; the artillerymen
gone; the Scottish cannon
and the silent dead were solely in possession
of the battle-ground. The thickest
heaps cumbered it on the spot where the
royal James and his phalanx had fought;
the breathless warriors lay just as death
had left them, for the marauding Borderers
had not dared to pursue their occupation
of stripping and plundering in the
full light of day."</p></div>

<p>Queen Margaret, however, did not
remain long inconsolable; she had
too much of the disposition of her
brother Henry VIII. in her to remain
long without a husband; and
she fixed her eyes on a handsome
youth, the Earl of Angus, whom she
soon afterwards married, to the no
small annoyance of her brother and
his subjects. Her marriage with him
gave occasion to the following pleasing
verses by Gawin Douglas, the
uncle of the nobleman thus honoured
by the smiles of royalty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Amidst them, borne within a golden chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-fret with pearls and colours most preclair,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With gemmed clasps closed in all perfite,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And in her hand a sceptre of delight.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So next her rode in granate-violet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve damsels, ilka ane on their estate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And next them was a lusty rout, God wot!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lords, ladies, and full mony a fair prelate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At easy pace&mdash;they riding forth the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I abode alone within the tree."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Margaret's life, after her second
marriage, was a series of adventures
and disasters partly occasioned by the
turbulent spirit and endless disorders
of the times, partly by her own passions.
She was a true Tudor in her
disposition. Like her brother, "she
spared no man in her lust, and no
woman in her hate." When she died,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
at the age of forty-eight, she had
already married four husbands, of
whom <i>three were still alive</i>. She divorced,
not beheaded, when she was
tired of her lovers: in that respect
she was better than Henry. By the
second of these husbands she had a
daughter, named Margaret, whose
birth took place in the following circumstances,
characteristic alike of the
age and country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The welcome message of Dacre arrived
at Coldstream almost in the last minute
that Queen Margaret could be moved.
So desperately ill was she taken on the
road, that her convoy were forced to stop
by the way, and hurry her into Harbottle
or Hardbattle Castle, one of the grimmest
and gauntest stone-donjons that
frowned on the English frontier. It was
just then garrisoned by Lord Dacre in
person, who had commenced the fierce
war on the Borders to which the arrival
of the Duke of Albany in Scotland had
given rise. The portcullis of Harbottle
was raised to admit the fainting Queen
of Scotland; but not one Scot, man or
woman, Lord Dacre vowed, should enter
with her. Here was a terrible situation
for Margaret. She was received into the
rugged Border-fortress, October 5, and,
after remaining in mortal agony for more
than forty-eight hours, gave birth to a
daughter, the Lady Margaret Douglas,
whose name is familiar to every one on
the pages of general history, as the immediate
ancestress of our present royal
family."</p></div>

<p>The death of Margaret Tudor suggests
the following reflections to our
author, the justice and beauty of
which makes us regret that she does
not more frequently speak in her own
person, instead of the quaint style of
ancient annalists.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Some of Margaret Tudor's mistakes in
government, it is possible, may be attributed
to the fact that she is the first
instance that occurs, since Christianity
was established in the island, of regnant
power being confided to the hands of a
woman who was expected to reign as
<i>femme seule</i>. She had no education,
scarcely any religion, and was guided
entirely by her instincts, which were not
of an elevated character. Her misdeeds,
and the misfortunes attributable to her
personal conduct, gave rise to most of the
terrible calamities which befell her descendants.
Some persons among the
aristocracy of Scotland followed her evil
example of divorce, which caused long
and angry litigation concerning the birthrights
of their descendants. The fearful
feud between the houses of Arran and
Darnley-Stuart was of this kind, which
deeply involved the prosperity of her
granddaughter, Mary Queen of Scots.
And that hapless Princess was likewise
marked as a victim by the cold and crafty
Ruthven, on account of his family interests
being affected by Queen Margaret's marriages
and divorces.</p>

<p>"A succession of tragedies, for three
generations, was the consequence of
Margaret Tudor's indulgence of her selfish
passions. Nor are the woes attendant
on contempt of the divine institution of
marriage limited to the great ones of the
earth. Many a domestic tragedy, though
shrouded in the obscurity of every-day
life, may be traced to the same cause.
Sorrow enters with sin; it desolates the
peace of home; and unoffending children
suffer for the evil of their parents, whenever
persons are found to break, either
by wilful passions or litigious contest,
the earliest law given by the Almighty."</p></div>

<p>The second Life in the volume is
that of Magdalene of Valois, the
beautiful first Queen of James V.,
the brevity of whose reign of <i>forty</i> days
in Scotland was the subject of such
lamentation to the country. James
went to Paris, in the true spirit of
chivalry, to choose and win a Queen
in person; and after a rapid and
somewhat discreditable homage to
Mary of Vend&ocirc;me, on the banks of
the Loire, his inconstant affections
were at length fixed by Magdalene
daughter of Francis I., whom he soon
after married, and who became his
much loved but short-lived Queen.
Their entrance into Scotland is thus
described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The royal voyagers made the port of
Leith, Saturday, May 19, being the fifth
day from their embarkation, and Whitsuneve.
They landed at the pier amidst the
acclamations of a mixed multitude of
loving lieges of all degrees, who came to
welcome their sovereign home, and to see
their new Queen. Magdalene endeared
herself for ever to the affections of the
people by the sensibility she manifested
on that occasion; for when 'she first
stepped on Scottish ground, she knelt,
and, bowing herself down, kissed the
moulds thereof for the love she bore the
King, returned thanks to God for having
brought the King and her safely through
the seas, and prayed for the happiness of
the country.' This was indeed entering
upon her high vocation, not like the cold
state puppet of a public pageant, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the spirit of a queen who felt and understood
the relation in which she stood both
to the King and people of that realm.
A touching sight it must have been to
those who saw that young royal bride
thus obey the warm impulse of a heart
overflowing with gratitude to God, and
love to all she then looked upon. The
venerable Sir David Lindsay of the
Mount, and other contemporary poets,
who were so soon to hang elegiac wreaths
of mournful verse on the early bier of
her who then stood among them in her
fragile and almost unearthly loveliness,
radiant with hope, and joy, and happy
love, called her 'the pleasant Magdalene,'
and 'the sweet Flower of France.'</p>

<p>"King James blithely conducted his
Queen to his palace of Holyrood; and, to
increase the universal satisfaction which
her appearance and manners had given,
the auspicious news quickly spread
through Edinburgh, that she was likely
to bring an heir to Scotland. Great
were the rejoicings in consequence. The
ancient prediction 'that the French wife
should bring a child the ninth in degree
from the left side of the stem of Bruce,
that should rule England and Scotland
from sea to sea,' was revived in anticipation
of the offspring of James V. of
Scotland by Magdalene of France, although
it would only have been the eighth
in descent from that illustrious stock."</p></div>

<p>Her premature and lamented death
is recorded in these feeling paragraphs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The early death of Magdalene was
not only a misfortune to her royal husband,
but a serious loss to Scotland, and
even to Christendom, on account of the
enlightened views she had received on
the all-important subject of religion.
Brant&ocirc;me tells us that 'she was very
deeply regretted not only by James V.
but by all his people, for she was very
good, and knew how to make herself truly
beloved. She had a great mind, and was
most wise and virtuous.' The first general
mourning ever known in Scotland was
worn for her, and her obsequies were
solemnised with the greatest manifestation
of sorrow of which that nation had ever
been participant. The lamentations for
the premature death of this youthful
Queen, and the hopes that perished with
her of an heir of Scotland, appear to
have been of a similar character to the
passionate and universal burst of national
sorrow which, in the present century,
pervaded all hearts in the Britannic empire,
for the loss of the noble-minded
Princess Charlotte of Wales and her
infant.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Mary of Lorraine, daughter of the
great Duke of Guise, and a lineal
descendant of Charlemagne, was the
second Queen of James V.: she is
peculiarly interesting, as her daughter
was Queen Mary; and she was
the ancestress of our present illustrious
sovereign. We have room only, however,
for one extract:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'Let us,' says an eloquent French
writer of the present day, 'enter the
grand gallery of the Chateau d'Eu, and
contemplate the noble portraits of the line
of Guise. There we shall view that old
Claud of Lorraine, clad in his heavy
cuirass, bearing his long sword, first dyed
in blood at Marignan, having for his
cortege and companions his six glorious
sons; then we shall see Francis of Lorraine,
rival of the Emperor Charles the
Fifth, and conqueror of Calais; near him
that Cardinal of Lorraine, eloquent as an
orator, gallant and magnificent as a prince,
yet an ambitious and cruel priest. And
there is the grandchild of Duke Claud,
Mary Stuart, angel of grief and poesy,
whose charming head bore a crown-regnant,
and yet fell beneath the axe of
the executioner.'</p>

<p>"The Duke and Duchess of Longueville
were both present at the bridal of James
V. and Magdalene of France. Little did
the Duchess imagine, when she, as the
wife of the representative of the brave
Dunois, and the eldest daughter of the
house of Guise-Lorraine, proudly took
high place among the great ladies of
France, near the person of the royal bride,
that the crown-matrimonial of Scotland&mdash;never
to be worn by her on whose finger
she saw the enamoured bridegroom place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the nuptial ring&mdash;was destined to encircle
her own brow. Far less could she have
believed, even if it had been predicted to
her, that from her union with that Prince
should proceed a line of sovereigns who
would reign not only over the Britannic
isles from sea to sea, but whose empire,
far exceeding that of her mighty ancestor
Charlemagne, should extend over India, a
considerable section of America, and include
vast portions of the habitable globe
whose existence was then unknown. Before
the anniversary returned of the day
that witnessed the nuptials of James and
Magdalene, all these apparently impossible
events were in an active state of
progression."</p></div>

<p>Miss Strickland has announced in
her Preface that two volumes are to
be devoted by her to the life of Queen
Mary; and that great light has been
thrown upon that interesting subject
by the important original letters
which Prince Labanoff's recent researches
and publication have brought
to light. We look with impatience
for the fulfilment of the promise; for,
although nothing can exceed in pathos
and interest Mr Tytler's entrancing
account of the captivity and death
of that celebrated and heroic princess,
yet we are well aware that much
light has since his time been thrown
on the subject, by the zealous labours
of chivalrous antiquaries. That she
may succeed in vindicating her memory
from much of the obloquy which,
despite her many great and noble
qualities, and matchless charms of
person and manner, still oppresses it,
is, we need hardly say, our most
anxious wish; and if any one can do
it, it is herself. But we confess we
have little expectation that it is possible
even for her chivalrous mind
and untiring industry to effect the
object. Our <i>present</i> view of this interesting
question is as follows:&mdash;The
strength of the case against Queen
Mary, during her reign in Scotland, is
such that it remains much the same
upon the admitted and incontestible
facts of history, though all the disputed
points were decided in her
favour. No original letters of hers,
or others which can be produced&mdash;no
complete disproval of those which
were charged, we believe falsely and
treacherously, against her&mdash;can do
away with her <i>acts</i>, whatever light
they may throw upon her motives, or
the unparalleled network of treachery,
selfishness, and duplicity, with which
she was surrounded. Can it be reasonably
hoped that any subsequent effort
of industry or ability will be able to do
more for Queen Mary's memory than
has been done by her gifted dramatic
biographer Schiller, who, in the awful
scene of her last confession to the
priest in prison, immediately before
being conducted to the block, makes
her admit her failings in the indulgence
of undue hatred against some,
and impassioned love to others; and
recount, with sincerity, her stings of
conscience for having permitted the
King, her husband, to be put to death,
and thereafter loaded with favours
and bestowed her hand on the party
charged with his murder? It is hopeless
to deny the magnitude of these
delinquencies, though men, at least,
should view them with an indulgent
eye; for they arose, as Schiller makes
her say, on that dread occasion, from
the self-forgetfulness and generous
feelings which led her to trust in a
sex by whom she was forsaken and
betrayed.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Such is our present view
of the case; but we have every confidence
in Miss Strickland's powers and
research, and shall impatiently await
the new light she will doubtless throw
on that most fascinating and tragic of
all biographies.</p>

<p>The truth appears to be, that Mary
was a mixed character: no uncommon
thing in every age, and especially so in
that disastrous and profligate one in
which Mary's lot was cast. She was
as charming and heroic as her most
impassioned advocates would represent,
and as impassioned, and in one
matter guilty, as her worst enemies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>allege. Her virtues, however, were
her own; her delinquencies, of the
religion in which she had been bred,
and the age in which she lived.
It was the age, and she had been bred
in the court, which witnessed the
successive murders of the Duke of
Guise and the Admiral Coligni at the
court of France; the Massacre of St
Bartholomew by a French king, and
the fires of Smithfield lighted by an
English queen. To one period, and
that the most interesting of her life,
unmixed praise may be given. From
the day of her landing in England,
her conduct was one of dignity, innocence,
and heroism; and if her
previous life was stained by the
imputation of having <i>permitted</i> one
murder, suggested to herself by despair,
and recommended by others from
profligacy, she expiated it by being
the victim of another, suggested by
jealousy, executed by rancour, and
directly ordered by a cruel relative
and a vindictive rival.</p>

<p>If there is any blemish in the very
interesting volume, of which our
limits will only permit a more cursory
notice than its high merits deserve,
it is to be found in the too frequent
use of quotations from old authorities
or original letters <i>in the text</i>, and the
mosaic-like appearance which is often
given to her pages, by the introduction
of quaint and antiquated expressions
drawn from contemporary writers in
the body of the narrative. We are
well aware of the motive which has
led to this, and we respect it as it
deserves: it arises from the wish to
be accurate and trustworthy, the anxious
desire to make her Lives a faithful
transcript of the times&mdash;to exhibit
their very "form and pressure." The
object was good, the desire was laudable;
but it is quite possible to be
carried too far, even in working out
the most praiseworthy principle.
Long accounts of dresses, decorations,
and processions; entries of expenses
in Treasurers' accounts; even original
letters, unless on very particular occasions,
are the materials of biography,
but they are not biography itself.
It is <i>living</i> character, not still life,
which we desire to see delineated:
the latter is the frame of the picture,
but it is not the picture itself. Such
curious details are characteristic,
generally amusing, often interesting;
but they, in general, do better
in foot-notes than in the body of the
narrative. We must admit, however,
that Miss Strickland has exhibited
equal judgment and skill in the manner
in which she has <i>fitted in</i> those
contemporary extracts into the body
of the narrative, and the selection
she has made of such as are most
curious and characteristic of the
times. By many, we are well aware,
they will be considered as not the
least interesting part of her very
interesting volumes. It is the principle
of introducing them in the <i>text</i>
that we wish her to reconsider.
Unity of composition is not less
essential to the higher productions
of art, in history or biography, than
in painting or the drama; and
Miss Strickland writes so powerfully,
and paints so beautifully, that we cannot
but often regret when we lose the
thread of her flowing narrative, to
make way for extracts from a quaint
annalist, or entries from the accounts
of a long-forgotten exchequer.</p>

<p>Wolf, the learned German, was
certainly very far wrong&mdash;as Germans
in their endless speculations are apt
to be&mdash;when he set himself to explain
the <i>Iliad</i> without Homer; an attempt
which, to our British ears, generally
sounded pretty much as profane as to
explain the world without God, or,
according to Cicero's simile against the
Epicureans, to explain the existence
of a book by the mere accidental out-tumbling
of alphabetic counters on
the ground. The <i>Iliad</i> could not have
existed without Homer&mdash;so the rude
instinct of the most unlearned and
most unmetaphysical English Bull
declared against the cloud-woven
theories and the deep-sunk lexicographical
excavations of the famous
Berlin professor; and the rude instinct,
after much philological sapping and
mining, stands ground. But Wolf did
not labour in vain. Though he did
not take the citadel, he made breaches
into many parts of our classical circumvallation,
formerly deemed most
strong, and made us change, in great
measure, the fashion of our fortifications.
In the same manner Niebuhr,
with his knotty club, made sad havoc
among the waxen images of the old
Romans, which the piety of Livy&mdash;taking
them for genuine granite statues&mdash;had
set forth with such a wealth
of fine patriotic elocution; but after
all this work of destruction, Rome still
remains with its Tiber, and, in the
minds of most sane persons, Romulus
also, we imagine; while the great
Julius shines a kingly star every inch,
as much after Niebuhr's strong brush
as before. What, then, was the great
truth by virtue of which&mdash;as stupid
sermons are redeemed by a good text&mdash;Wolf,
with his startling anti-Homeric
gospel, made so many proselytes,
and such fervid apostles,
among the learned and the poetic of
his countrymen? Plainly this, that
he seized with a keen glance, and a
grand comprehensiveness, the minstrel
character of the <span class="smcap">Popular Epos</span> of
early ages, as distinguished from the
more artificial and curiously-piled
compositions of more polished times,
bearing the same name. Wolf was
wrong&mdash;say mad, if you please&mdash;in asserting
that Pisistratus, with a whole
army of such refurbishers of old wares
as Onomacritus, could have put together
such a glowing vital whole as
the <i>Iliad</i>; but he was right, and altogether
sound, when he looked upon the
great Epic song of the wrath of Achilles
as a thing essentially different, not
only in degree, but in kind, from the
<i>&AElig;neid</i> of Virgil, or the <i>Paradise Lost</i>
of our Milton. Many men of learning
and taste, from Scaliger downwards,
have instituted large and curious comparisons
between the great national
Epos of the Greeks, and that of the
Romans; but the comparison of things
that have a radically different character
can seldom produce any result
beyond the mere expression of liking
and disliking; as if, among critics of
trees, one should say, <i>I prefer a bristling
pine</i>, while another says, <i>Give me
the smooth beech</i>. Or, a result even
more unsatisfactory might be produced.
Starting from the beech as a sort of
model tree, a forest critic, predetermined
to admire the pine also, might
spin out of his brain a number of subtle
analogies to prove that a pine, though
bearing a different name, is, in fact,
the same tree as a beech, and possesses,
when <i>more</i> philosophically considered,
all the essential characteristics
of this tree. You laugh?&mdash;but so, and
not otherwise, did it fare with old
Homer, at the hands of many professional
philologists and literary dilettantes,
who, with a perfect appreciation
of such works of polished skill as
the <i>&AElig;neid</i> and the <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>&mdash;as
being akin to their own modern
taste&mdash;must needs apply the same
test to take cognisance of such
strange and far-removed objects as the
<i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>. Such transference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>of the mould that measures one thing
to another, and an altogether different
thing, is indeed a common enough
trick of our every-day judgments; but
it is, nevertheless, a sort of criticism
altogether barren of any positive results,
and which ends where it begins&mdash;in
talk. To the character and certainty
of a science, it can assuredly
have no claim. If you wish to descant
with any beneficial result upon roses,
pray compare one English rose with
another, and not with a Scotch thistle.
Bring not the fine city dame into contact
with the brown country girl; but
let Lady B's complexion be more delicate
than Lady C's, and the brown of
Bessie be more healthy than that of
Jessie. Jessie, if you will consider
the matter, has nothing in common
with Lady B, except this, that she is
a woman. As little has Homer in
common with Virgil, or Tasso, or
Milton. With whom, then, is Homer
to be compared? A hundred years
ago, Voltaire, with all his wit, could
not have answered that question&mdash;the
whole age of European criticism of
which Voltaire was the oracle and the
god could not have answered it; but
thanks&mdash;after the Percy Ballads, and
Cowper, and Wordsworth, and
Southey, and Burns&mdash;to Frederick
Augustus Wolf, that question we can
answer now in the simplest and most
certain way in the world, by pointing
to the famous Spanish <span class="smcap">Cid</span>, and the
old Teutonic <span class="smcap">Lay</span> of the <span class="smcap">Niebelungen</span>.</p>

<p>To the Cid, we may presume that
those of our readers who love popular
poetry, and are not happy enough to
know the sonorous old Castilian, have
been happily introduced by the great
work of Southey. But, with respect
to the other great popular Epos of
Western Europe, we suspect Mr <span class="smcap">Lettsom</span>
is only too much in the right
when he says, that this venerable
monument of the old German genius is
"so little known amongst us, that
most ordinary readers have not so
much as heard of it. Even amongst the
numerous and increasing class of those
who are acquainted with German,
few pay attention to the ancient
literature of Germany: they are generally
conversant only with the productions
of the day, or, at farthest,
with those of the most celebrated
authors." So, indeed, it must be;
the necessary business and amusements
of life leave but few of us at
liberty to follow the example of the
learned Germans, and refuse to look
at Helen before we have critically
investigated the history of Jove's
amours, and of Leda's egg. So much
the more are we beholden to gentlemen
like the present translator, who,
by the patient exercise of those pious
pains which are the pleasure of poets,
put us into the condition of being able
to hear the notes of that strange old
Teutonic lyre prolonged through the
aisles of an English echo-chamber.
Mr Lettsom has done a work, much
wanted for the English lover of
poetry, honestly and well: this we
can say from having compared it in
various places with a prose translation
of the old German poem, published
at Berlin in 1814;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> also from the
distinct recollection which we have of
the character and tone of the modern
German version of Marbach, which we
read for the first time several years
ago. But Mr Lettsom's translation
bears also internal evidence of its
excellence: there is a quiet simplicity
and easy talkative breadth about it,
characteristic no less of the general
genius of the Germans than of the
particular medi&aelig;val epoch to which it
belongs. With a perfect confidence,
therefore, in the trustworthiness of the
present English version, we proceed to
lay before our readers a rapid sketch
of the Epic story of the Niebelungen,
accompanied with such extracts as
may serve to convey an idea of the
general tone and character of the
composition.</p>

<p>At Worms, upon the Rhine, (so
the poem opens,) there dwelt three
puissant kings&mdash;Gunther and Gernot
and Gieselher&mdash;three brothers, of
whom Gunther was the eldest, and, in
right of primogeniture, swayed the
sceptre of Burgundy.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> These kings
had a sister named Kriemhild, the real
heroine and fell female Achilles of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>Epos; for though she is as gentle and
mild as a Madonna till her love is
wounded, after that she nourishes a
desire of vengeance on the murderers
of her husband, as insatiate and inexorable
as that which the son of
Peleus, in the <i>Iliad</i>, nurses against
the son of Atreus for the rape of
the lovely Briseis. In fact, as the
great work of Homer might be
more fully designated <i>the wrath of
Achilles</i>, so the most significant designation
for this medi&aelig;val Iliad of the
Germans would be <i>the revenge of
Kriemhild</i>. After naming these, and
other notable personages of the Burgundian
court at Worms, the poet
makes use of a dream, as &AElig;schylus
in the <i>Agamemnon</i> uses an omen, to
open up, in a fitful glimpse of prophecy,
the general burden and fateful
issue of his tale.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A dream was dreamed by Kriemhild, the virtuous and the gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How a wild young falcon she trained for many a day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In all the world such sorrow as this perforce to see.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To her mother Uta at once the dream she told;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she the threatening future could only thus unfold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The falcon that thou trainedst is sure a noble mate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God shield him in his mercy, or thou must lose him straight.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A mate for me! What say'st thou, dearest mother mine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er to love, assure thee, my heart will I resign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll live and die a maiden, and end as I began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor (let what else befall me) will suffer woe for man.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Nay!' said the anxious mother, 'renounce not marriage so;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst thou true heartfelt pleasure taste ever here below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man's love alone can give it. Thou'rt fair as eye can see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fitting mate God send thee, and naught will wanting be.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'No more,' the maiden answered, 'no more, dear mother, say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From many a woman's fortune, this truth is clear as day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That falsely smiling pleasure with pain requites us ever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I from both will keep me, and thus will sorrow never.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So in her lofty virtue, fancy-free and gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lived the noble maiden many a happy day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor one more than another found favour in her sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, at the last, she wedded a far-renowned knight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was the self-same falcon she in her dream had seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foretold by her wise mother. What vengeance took the queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her nearest kinsmen, who him to death had done!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That single death atoning died many a mother's son."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With these words ends the very
short first canto, or, in the phraseology
of the bard, "adventure" of the poem.
The second introduces us to the most
prominent male character in the first
part of the poem&mdash;for it is divided into
two distinct parts or acts&mdash;the famous
<span class="smcap">Siegfried</span>, "with the horny hide,"
as the old German chap-book has it,
which any of our readers may have for
a groschen or two in Leipzig, and not
more, we suppose, than a sixpence here.</p>

<span class="i0">"In Netherland there flourished a prince of lofty kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Whose father hight Siegmund, his mother Siegelind)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Men did call it Xanten; 'twas famous far and wide."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This princely youth, who, like the
Spanish Cid, is perfect even to the
smallest hair on his beard, after having
employed his early days, like ancient
Hercules and Theseus, in attacking
and overcoming every sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>terrible monster, in bestial or human
guise, that came in his way, is dubbed
knight with the stroke of the chivalrous
sword, in due form, and a festival
is held in honour of the event, the
description of which occupies the
"second adventure." Like a dutiful
son, as well as a fearless knight, he
will accept no royal honours, or
share in the official dignities of government,
so as long as his father and

<span class="i0">The bed of sloth but seldom the noble knight could brook!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He only sought for battles: his prowess-gifted hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won him renown eternal in every foreign strand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But even the sturdy mail-clad heroes
of medi&aelig;val knighthood sometimes
tired of "battles;" and when
they were thus aweary, they had one
other serious occupation, and that, of
course, was love. With the entrance
on this new career, the third adventure
is occupied.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Twas seldom tear or sorrow the warrior's breast assayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length he heard a rumour how a lovely maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Burgundy was dwelling, the fairest of the fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her he won much pleasure, but dash'd with toil and care."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Siegfried opens his determination
to his parents to follow the fortune of
this rumour, and take to wife none
other than&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The bright Burgundian maiden, best gem of Gunther's throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose far-renowned beauty stands unapproached alone."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This resolution, of course, as is the
fortune of true love, meets with opposition,
at first, from the parents of the
youth; but with a calm and decided
answer, such as true love knows how
to give, the difficulty is overcome.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i34">"Dearest father mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love of high-born women for ever I'll resign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather than play the wooer but where my heart is set."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Forthwith, therefore, he sets out on
an expedition to Worms, predetermined,
after the common fashion of
medi&aelig;val love-romances, to marry the
woman whom he had never seen; for
in these matters, rumour, it was
thought&mdash;that plays so falsely elsewhere&mdash;could
not err. To make the
necessary impression on so mighty a
king as Gunther, the Prince of the
Netherland is pranked out most gorgeously
with all that woman's needle
can produce of chivalrous embroidery;
and, thus accoutred,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On the seventh fair morning, by Worms along the strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In knightly guise were pricking the death-defying band;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their steeds they meetly governed, all pacing soft abreast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Their shields were new and massy, and like flame they glowed;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Eye never looked on champions so gorgeously arrayed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down to their spurs, loud clanging, reached the swords they wore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp and well-tempered lances the chosen champions bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, two spans broad or better, did Siegfried sternly shake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With keen and cutting edges grim and ghastly wounds to make.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Their golden-coloured bridles firm they held in hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silken were their poitrals: so rode they through the land.<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>Then follows the formal reception
at the court of Worms, and, as on
all great festival occasions in those
days, a tournament is held, where
the stranger knight, of course, acquits
himself like a god rather than a man,
to the admiration of all beholders,
but specially of the gentle ladies, who,
on occasions when propriety did not
allow them publicly to appear, enjoy
the dear delight of gazing on bearded
swordsmen even more exquisitely
from behind a window.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"At court the lovely ladies were asking evermore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was the stately stranger that so rich vesture wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once so strong of presence and so strong of hand?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When many a one gave answer, 'Tis the King of Netherland.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He ever was the foremost, whate'er the game they played.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still in his inmost bosom he bore one lovely maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom he beheld had never, and yet to all preferred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She too of him, in secret, spoke many a kindly word.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When in the court contending, fierce squire and hardy knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fits the young and noble, waged the mimic fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft Kriemhild through her windows would look, herself unseen&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then no other pleasure needed the gentle Queen."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But though Kriemhild saw Siegfried
through the window, Siegfried
remained with Gunther a whole
year,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nor all that weary season a single glimpse could gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her who after brought him such pleasure and such pain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Like the disciples of Pythagoras,
the amorous knights of those days
had first to serve a long apprenticeship
of the severe discipline of abstinence,
before they were permitted to
kiss the hand of beauty, or to meet
even its distant glance. The fourth
adventure, therefore, goes on to tell
how Siegfried showed his prowess by
fighting with the Saxons, who had
come under the guidance of their king,
Ludeger the Bold, and leagued with
him King Ludegast of Denmark, to
attack the realm of the Burgundians.
Coming home, like a Mars-subduing
Diomede, from this fierce encounter,
the knight of the Netherland is at
length deemed worthy to be introduced
to his destined fair. Another
tourney is held, at which Kriemhild
publicly appears.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now went she forth the loveliest, as forth the morning goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From misty clouds out-beaming: then all his weary woes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left him in heart who bore her, and so long time had done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw there stately standing the fair, the peerless one.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many a stone full precious flashed from her vesture bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her rosy blushes darted a softer, ruddier light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er might be his wishes, each could not but confess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ne'er on earth had witnessed such perfect loveliness.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the moon arising out glitters every star,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well might, at such a vision, many a bold heart beat high."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With not less of serene beauty, and
a quiet naturalness that is peculiar to
him, the old bard describes the feelings
of Siegfried on first coming within
the sweet atmosphere of woman's
love.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There stood he, the high-minded, beneath her star-bright eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cheek as fire all glowing; then said she modestly,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet loftier at that greeting rose his lofty mood.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He bowed with soft emotion, and thanked the blushing fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love's strong constraint together impelled the enamoured pair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their longing eyes encountered, their glances, every one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound knight and maid for ever; yet all by stealth was done.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That in the warmth of passion he pressed her lily hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not know for certain, but well can understand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere surely past believing they ventured not on this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two loving hearts, so meeting, else had done amiss.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No more in pride of summer, nor in bloom of May,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His own, a dream no longer, was standing by his side.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">None yet was champion who so deserved a queen."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus far well. But his probation
was not yet finished. Before finally
joining hand and heart with the peerless
sister of King Gunther, Siegfried
must assist her brother in a yet more
difficult work than anything that he
had hitherto achieved&mdash;in gaining the
love of Brunhild, a doughty princess
of Iceland, "far beyond the sea," who,
being of a masculine temper and
strength, had determined to submit
herself to no male lord who had not
proved himself worthy to wield the
marital sceptre, by actually mastering
his spouse in strong physical conflict.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was a queen high-seated afar beyond the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None wielded sceptre a mightier than she;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For beauty she was matchless, for strength without a peer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her love to him she offered who could pass her at the spear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She threw the stone, and bounded behind it to the mark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At three games each suitor, with sinews stiff and stark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must conquer the fierce maiden whom he sought to wed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if in one successless, straight must lose his head.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">E'en thus for the stern virgin had many a suitor died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This heard a noble warrior, who dwelt the Rhine beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forthwith resolved he to win her for his wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereby full many a hero thereafter lost his life."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Doubtful of his single strength to
subdue so mettlesome a maid, Gunther
enters into a compact with Siegfried
to assist him in his enterprise&mdash;<i>by fair
means or foul</i>, as it appears; and in
this evil compact, and the underhand
work to which it gives rise, lies already
visible before the unveiled eye
of the reader, the little black spot
on the fair blue of the epic sky,
which is destined (and the bard is
ever forward to hint this catastrophe,)
at a day though distant yet
sure, to dilate into a wide-spreading
cloud, and to burst in a fearful deluge
that shall sweep hundreds and thousands
of the guilty and the guiltless
into destruction. This is neither more
nor less than the dark old doctrine of
retribution, which in the Greek tragedians,
and especially &AElig;schylus, plays
so awful a part; only with this difference,
that in the Niebelungen, as in
the Odyssey, the punishment overtakes
the offending parties, and not,
as in the tragedians, their sons and
grandsons. But to proceed: Siegfried,
like Jack the Giant-killer, though
commencing his career as a single
mortal with no miraculous power, had
in the course of his chivalrous exploits,
and as the reward of his extraordinary
prowess, got possession of certain
wonder-working instruments, that
rendered him, when he chose to use
them, sure of victory against mere
mortal strength. With the aid of
these, Siegfried, for the sake of the
love of Kriemhild, had determined
(secretly and unfairly) to assist
Gunther in subduing the stout Brunhild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have heard strange stories of wild dwarfs, how they fare:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus Siegfried won fair Brunhild, which brought him bitterest woe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In order the more surely to afford
his necessary aid, Siegfried appeared
among the attendants of Gunther, in
the character of a subordinate vassal.
Having thus arranged matters, they
set out for the far island of the sea.
And here, as in many other passages,
it is noticeable with what a childlike,
almost girlish delight, the old bard
expatiates on the gay dress of his
mighty men. He evidently did not
live in an age when a Napoleon would
have sought to make an impression on
the vulgar by "wearing the plain
dress of the Institute;" nor has he
the slightest conception of the soul of
poetry beating in a breast of which
the exterior vesture is the "hodden
grey," or the plain plaid of our Scotch
Muse. We shall quote this one passage
to serve for many similar, with
which the poem is studded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So with kind dismissal away the warriors strode;<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>With the arrival of the kingly travellers,
and their reception at Iceland,
we cannot afford to detain ourselves.
Suffice it to say, that, by the aid of
the secret invisible cloak (<i>Tarnkappe</i>)
of Siegfried, and his good sword
Balmung, Gunther is greeted by the
vanquished Brunhild as her legitimate
lord and master; and sails back with
him to Worms, where she is most
hospitably and magnificently received
by her mother-in-law, dame Uta, and
her now sister, the lovely Kriemhild.
A double marriage then takes place;
that of King Gunther with Brunhild,
and that of Siegfried with Kriemhild;
and the festivities which then
took place furnish the poet with
another opportunity for exercising his
descriptive powers, and displaying
the sunny joyousness of his social
nature. Herein, as in many other
points, he is quite Homeric; a certain
magnificence and amplitude in
the common acts of eating and drinking
being as essential to his idea of
poetry as the luxuriant energy of
more lofty functions. But in the
midst of this connubial hilarity, the
black spot of destiny begins perceptibly
to enlarge into a threatening
cloud; and the stately Brunhild
begins to show herself as possessed by
that pride which the wise man tells us
was not made for man, and which,
wherever it is harboured, is not long
of banishing love, confidence, peace,
and happiness from palace as from
cabin. The haughty spouse of Gunther
looks with an evil eye at Siegfried,
whom she had known only in
his assumed character as vassal of her
husband, judging it an affront that
her sister-in-law should be given
away to a mere vassal. The respect
with which the hero of Netherland is
treated by her husband, and the whole
court, she cannot and will not understand.
Either he is a vassal, and then
her pride is justly offended at the unequal
match; or he is not, and then
Gunther had deceived her with regard
to the true character of his companion&mdash;and
there must be some mystery
beneath this, which, as a true daughter
of Eve, she can have no rest till she
unveils. Possessed by these feelings,
she takes a course worthy of the masculine
character for which she had
early been so notable. On the
marriage-night she resumes her old
virgin obstinacy, and will not be
tamed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Sir knight,' said she, 'it suits not&mdash;you'd better leave me free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all your present purpose&mdash;it must and shall not be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maid still will I keep me&mdash;(think well the matter o'er)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I am told that story.' This fretted Gunther sore."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Alas, poor Gunther! So has it ever
fared with men who marry women
with beards. The embrace-less bride
took a cord, which she wove strong
and tough about her wrist, and with
that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The feet and hands of Gunther she tied together all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to a rail she bore him, and hung him 'gainst the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade him not disturb her, nor breathe of love a breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure from the doughty damsel he all but met his death."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this dilemma Siegfried with his
invisible cloak was again called in,
and did strange service a second time
in helping Gunther to subjugate his
refractory yoke-fellow. Brunhild
then became tame, and, like Samson,
lost her wondrous strength; while
Siegfried, as a sort of memorial of this
notable service, secretly abstracted
and brought with him a golden ring
which the stately lady used to wear
on her fine finger, and likewise the
girdle with which she had tied her
lord; and both these, in an evil hour,
he gave to his wife&mdash;"a gift that mischief
wrought," as we shall presently
see.</p>

<p>After these achievements, the horny
hero retired home to the land of his
father Siegmund and his mother
Siegelind; and after remaining ten
years with him, "the fair queen, his
consort, bore him at last an heir."
All this time the haughty spirit of
Brunhild was brooding over the deep
wrong.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why should the lady Kriemhild herself so proudly bear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet her husband Siegfried, what but our man is he?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And late but little service has yielded for his fee."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>And to clear up this matter, as
well as for the sake of old kindness,
an invitation is sent by King Gunther
to the heroine in Netherland, which is
accepted. Siegfried and Kriemhild,
and the hoary-headed old Siegmund,
come with a great company to
Worms, and are entertained in the
sumptuous fashion that, as before
remarked, the material old minstrel
describes with so much zest.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sore toiled the chief cook, Rumolt; Oh! how his orders ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among his understrappers! how many a pot and pan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many a mighty caldron retched and rang again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They dressed a world of dishes for all the expected train."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The high festal was kept for eleven
days; but the loud merriment, which
so luxuriantly was bellowed forth to
Siegfried's honour, failed to deafen
the evil whisper of pride and jealousy
in the dark heart of Brunhild.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then thought Queen Brunhild, 'Silent I'll no longer remain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However to pass I bring it, Kriemhild shall explain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore so long her husband, who holds of us in fee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has left undone his service: this sure shall answered be.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So still she brooded mischief, and conned her devil's lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she broke off in sorrow the feast so blythe before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever at her heart lay closely what came perforce to light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a land she startled with horror and affright."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The cloud thickens; and the first
thunder-plump, prophetic of the destined
deluge, will immediately burst.
Jealousy is a spider that never wants
flies. In the midst of the tilting and
junketing, the two queens&mdash;as queens,
like other idle women, will sometimes
do&mdash;began to discourse on the merits
of their respective husbands; in the
course of which conversation, the
most natural thing in the world was
that Brunhild should proclaim her old
cherished belief that Siegfried, as a
mere dependent vassal, could never
be put into comparison with Gunther,
who was his king and superior. On
this, Kriemhild, whose gentleness,
where the honour of her lord was
concerned, fired into lionhood, gave
the retort with a spirit more worthy
of Brunhild than herself. She said
that, to prove her equality with the
wife of Gunther, she would walk into
the cathedral publicly before her;
and she did so. This was bad
enough; but, following the inspiration
of her womanly wrath once roused,
she divulged the fatal fact of her
possession of Brunhild's ring and
girdle&mdash;expressing, at the same time,
plainly her belief that her husband
Siegfried could not have come by
these tokens in any way consistent
with the honour of the original possessor.
Here now was a breach between
the two queens, that no human
art could heal. In vain was Siegfried
appealed to by Gunther, to
testify to the chastity of Brunhild.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Women must be instructed,' said Siegfried the good knight,<br /></span>

<p>The haughty princess of Iceland
now perceives that she had from the
beginning been practised upon by
Gunther, and that Siegfried had performed
the principal part in the plot.
Against him, therefore, she vows revenge;
and, in order to accomplish
his purpose, takes into her counsels
<span class="smcap">Hagan</span> chief of Trony, one of the
most prominent characters in the
poem, and who in fact may be looked
on as the hero of the second part,
after Siegfried has disappeared from
the scene. This Hagan is a person
of gigantic energy and great experience,
but utterly destitute of gentleness
and tenderness; all his aims are
selfish, and a cold calculating policy
is his highest wisdom. Conscience
he seems to have none; and, except
for a purpose, will scarcely trouble
himself to conceal his perpetration of
the foulest crimes. He has the aspect
of Napoleon&mdash;as he is painted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
graphic pencil of Emerson. Like
Napoleon, he never hesitates to use
falsehood to effect his ends. Pretending
extraordinary friendship for
Kriemhild, he worms from her the
secret of her husband's invulnerability,
or rather of his vulnerability&mdash;like
Achilles&mdash;on only one part of the body.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Possessed of this secret, Hagan
finds it easy to watch an opportunity
for despatching him. A hunting party
is proposed; and when the hunters
are dispersed in the tangled wilds of
the Wask (Vosges) forest, Hagan,
with Gunther, who was accessory,
secretly draws Siegfried aside to refresh
himself, after hard sport, from
the clear waters of a sylvan well;
and, while he is kneeling down, transfixes
him between the shoulders on
the fatal spot with a spear. Then&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The death of Siegfried is the catastrophe
of the first part of the poem.
Kriemhild laments the death of her
peerless knight with a love more than
the love of common women, and
which feeds itself on the intense hatred
of the murderer, and the inly-cherished
expectation of revenge. The hoary
old Siegmund returns home in silent
sorrow, for he is too weak to offer
resistance; and, to complete the
matchless wrong, the thorough-working,
never-hesitating Hagan takes
unjust possession of "the Niebelungen
treasure"&mdash;a famous hoard bestowed
by Siegfried on his wife&mdash;thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
depriving the fair widow of the means
of external munificence, as he had
formerly stopt her source of inward
consolation. Not avarice, but policy,
was Hagan's motive for this, as for
all his crimes. He was never a villain
without a reason.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'A prudent man,' said Hagan, 'not for a single hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would such a mass of treasure leave in a woman's power.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She'll hatch, with all this largess, to her outlandish crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something that hereafter all Burgundy may rue.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A deep desire of revenge now
takes possession of the once gentle
mind of Kriemhild; and all the milk
of her affections is metamorphosed
into gall. The best things, it is
proverbially said, when abused, become
the worst; and so the revenge
of Kriemhild, revealed in the second
part of an essentially Christian poem,
works out a catastrophe far more
bloody than the warlike wrath of the
heathen Pelidan, or the well-calculated
retribution worked by the bow
of the cunning Ulysses,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>We have now finished a rapid outline
of nineteen adventures of the
Niebelungen Lay; and there are thirty
such divisions in the whole poem.
Our space forbids us to detail what
follows with equal fullness; but the
extracts already given will have been
sufficient to give the reader a fair idea
of the general character of the composition.
A brief summary of the progress
of the story, till it ends in the
sanguinary retribution, may therefore
content us.</p>

<p>For thirteen years after the death
of Siegfried, Kriemhild remained a
widow. At the end of that period a
knightly messenger, Sir Rudeger of
Bechelaren, came from Etzel, King of
the Huns, requesting the fair sister of
King Gunther to supply the place of
his queen, "Dame Helca," lately deceased.
Nursing silently the religion
of sorrow, the widow at first refused
steadfastly to give ear to any message
of this description; Hagan also, with
his dark far-seeing wisdom, gave his
decided negative to the proposal,
knowing well that, beneath the calm
exterior of time-hallowed grief, the
high-hearted queen, never forgetting
by whose hand her dear lord had
fallen, still nursed the sleepless appetite
for revenge. The brothers of the
king, however, his other counsellors,
and Dame Uta, urged the acceptance
of the proposal, with the hope thereby,
no doubt, of compensating in some
degree to the royal widow for the injury
at whose infliction they had connived.
But all this moved not
Kriemhild; only the distinct pledge
given by Rudeger that he would help
her, when once the sharer of King
Etzel's throne, to avenge herself of all
her enemies, at length prevailed. She
married a second husband mainly to
acquire the means of avenging the
death of the first. Under the protection
of Margrave Rudeger therefore,
and with bad omens only from the
lowering brows of Sir Hagan, the
widow of Siegfried takes her departure
from Worms, and proceeding through
Bavaria, and down the Danube&mdash;after
being hospitably entertained by the
good bishop Pilgrin of Passau&mdash;arrives
at Vienna, where she receives a
magnificent welcome from "the wide-ruling
Etzel," and his host of motley
courtiers, pranked with barbaric pomp
and gold, that far outshone the
brightest splendour of the Rhine.
Polacks and Wallachians, Greeks and
Russians, Thuringians and Danes,
attend daily, and do knightly service
in the court of the mighty King of the
Huns. The marriage feast was held
for seventeen days with all pomp and
revelry; and after that the happy
monarch set out with Kriemhild for
his castle at Buda. There he dwelt
"in proudest honour, feeling nor woe
nor sorrow," for seven years, during
which time Kriemhild bore him a son,
but only one, whom the pious wife
prevailed with her lord to have baptised
after the Christian custom.
Meanwhile, in her mind she secretly
harboured the same deep-rooted determination
of most unchristian revenge;
and towards the dark Hagan
delay only intensified her hatred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Accordingly, that she might find
means of dealing back to him the blow
which he had inflicted on her first
husband, she prevailed on Etzel to
invite her brothers, with their attendants,
and especially Hagan, to come
from the far Rhine, and partake the
hospitality of the Huns in the East.
This request, from motives partly of
kindness, partly of curiosity, was at
once responded to by all: only, as
usual, the dark Hagan stands alone,
and prophesies harm. He knew he
had done a deed that could not be
pardoned; and he foresaw clearly
that, in going to Vienna, he was
marching into a lion's den, whence,
for him, certainly there was no return.
But, with a hardihood that never
deserts him, if for no other reason
than that no one may dare to
call him a coward, he goes along
with the doomed band, the only conscious
among so many unconscious,
who were destined to turn the halls
of Hunnish merriment into mourning,
and to change the wine of the banqueters
into blood. So far, however,
his dark anticipations prevailed with
his unsuspecting comrades, that they
marched in great force and well
armed; so that when, after encountering
some bloody omens on the long
road, they did at length encounter
the false fair welcome of the injured
queen, they were prepared to sell their
lives dearly, and to die standing. No
sooner arrived than they were well
advertised by the redoubted Dietrich
of Bern, (Verona,) then attached to
Etzel's court, of the temper of their
hostess, and of the deathful dangers
that awaited them behind the fair
show of regal hospitality. This information
only steeled the high heart
of Hagan the more to meet danger in
the only way that suited his temper,
by an open and disdainful defiance.
He and his friend Volker, the "valiant
gleeman," who plays a distinguished
part in the catastrophe of the
poem, doggedly seated themselves
before the palace gate, and refused to
do homage to the Queen of the Huns
in her own kingdom; and, as if to
sharpen the point of her revenge, displayed
across his knees his good
broadsword, that very invincible
<i>Balmung</i> which had once owned no
hand but that of Siegfried. This display
of defiance was a fitting prelude
to the terrible combat that followed.
Though the knight of Trony was the
only object of Lady Kriemhild's
hatred, connected as he was with the
rest of the Burgundians, it was impossible
that the sword should reach
his heart without having first mowed
down hundreds and thousands of the
less important subordinates. Accordingly,
the sanguinary catastrophe of
the tragedy consists in this, that in
order to expiate the single sin of
Hagan&mdash;proceeding as that did originally
out of the false dealing of Siegfried,
and the wounded pride of
Brunhild&mdash;the whole royal family of
the Burgundians or Niebelungers are
prostrated in heaps of promiscuous
slaughter with their heathen foemen,
the Huns. The slaughter of the
suitors, in the twenty-second book of
the Odyssey, is ferocious enough to
our modern feelings; but the gigantic
butchery with which the Niebelungen
Lay concludes out-purples that as far
as the red hue of Sylla's murders
did the pale castigation of common
politicians. Eight books are occupied
in describing the details of this red
ruin, which a woman's revenge worked;
and the different scenes are
painted out with a terrific grandeur,
that resembles more the impression
produced by some horrid opium
dream than a human reality. Victim
after victim falls before the Titanic
vastness of the Burgundian heroes&mdash;Gunther,
and Gernot, and Gieselher,
the valiant gleeman Volker, who
flourishes his broadsword with a
humorous ferocity, as if it were his
fiddlestick, and, above all, the dark
Hagan himself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Well grown and well compacted was that redoubted guest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long were his legs and sinewy, and deep and broad his chest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hair, that once was sable, with grey was dashed of late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And terrible his visage, and lordly was his gait."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Finding her first attempt at midnight
assassination fail, the Queen
first commits her cause to Bloedel,
the brother of Etzel; but in an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
his head was severed from his body
by the might of Sir Dankwart. A
terrible massacre ensues, during which
the banqueting hall of King Etzel is
turned into a charnel-house. Then
Iring, the Danish Margrave, falls in
single combat with Hagan. An infuriate
rush is now made by the Huns
against the Burgundians, who had
fortified themselves in the hall; but
against such men as Dankwart,
Hagan, and Volker, they avail no
more than hail against the granite
rock.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thereafter reigned deep silence, the din of war was hushed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through every crack and cranny the blood on all sides gushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that large hall of slaughter; red did the gutters run.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much was through their prowess by those of Rhineland done."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Kriemhild then, finding all her efforts
with the sword baffled, sets fire to
the hall; but, the roof being vaulted,
even this application of the terror
that scared Napoleon from Moscow,
did not subdue the Promethean endurance
of the Burgundians. The noble
Margrave Rudeger is at last appealed
to, as bound by his promise made to
Kriemhild at Worms to prosecute
the bloody work of her revenge to
the last; but he also, with five hundred
of his men, falls in the bloody wrestling,
and with him his adversary Gernot,
the brother of Gunther. Last of all, the
haughty defiant spirit of the unsubdued
Hagan draws, though unwilling, the
redoubted Dietrich of Bern into the
fight; and before his might Hagan
himself is not slain, but taken captive,
that he may be reserved to glut the
private appetite of the sanguinary
queen. "<i>Bring me here John the
Baptist's head in a charger!</i>" Nothing
less than this will satisfy the
terrible revenge of Kriemhild. With
her own hand she lifts up the terrible
sword Balmung, and, meeting Hagan
face to face in the dark prison, and
charging him hot to the heart with his
deadly wrongs, severs the head from
his body. Kriemhild's revenge is now
complete. But the revenge of Him
who rules above required one other
blow. This was immediately executed
by the aged master Hildebrand, one
of Dietrich's company. And the
poem concludes, like a battle-field,
many to weep for, and only a
few to weep.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There now the dreary corpses stretched all around were seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lay, hewn in pieces, the fair and noble queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Dietrich and King Etzel, their tears began to start;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For kinsmen, and for vassals, each sorrowed in his heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mighty and the noble there lay together dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this had all the people dole and drearihead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feast of royal Etzel was thus shut up in woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pain in the steps of pleasure treads ever here below."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the singular poem, of which a
brief but complete outline now stands
before us, many remarks of a critical
and historical nature might be made;
but we confine ourselves to three
short observations, and with these
leave the matter to the private meditations
of the reader. <i>First</i>, that the
poem is not "snapt out of the air,"
as the Germans say, but has a historical
foundation, seems sufficiently
manifest&mdash;Etzel being plainly the
famous Attila, Dietrich, Theodoric the
Goth, and counterparts to Siegfried
and Gunther being producible from
the early history of the Franks.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Besides this, it is perfectly plain, from
the analogy of the Cid, and other
popular poetry of the narrative character,
that not religious allegory&mdash;as
some Germans would have it&mdash;but
actual, though confused and exaggerated
history, is the real staple of such
composition. The nucleus of the
story of the Burgundian Kings, and
the revenge of Kriemhild, belongs,
probably, to the century following
that in which Attila was so prominent
a character. But the complete poem,
in its present shape, is not later than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>the thirteenth century. Its author is
not known.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, the lay of the Niebelungen
is extremely interesting, as
disproving, so far as analogy may
avail to do so, the Wolfian theory
above alluded to, of the composition
of the <i>Iliad</i> out of a number of separate
ballads. Lachmann has tried the
same process of disintegration with
the unknown Homer of his own
country; but a sound-minded Englishman
needs but to read the poem as it
has been given us, for the first time,
complete by Mr Lettsom,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in order to
stand aghast at the extreme trouble
which learned men in Germany often
give themselves, in order to prove nonsense.
"<i>Nihil est tam absurdum quod
non scripserit aliquis Germanorum.</i>"</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, as a poetical composition,
the Lay of the Niebelungen will
not bear comparison for a moment
with the two great Greek works of
the same class; it is even, in our
opinion, inferior to its nearest modern
counterpart, the <i>Cid</i>. The author of
the <i>Iliad</i> possessed a soul as sunny
and as fiery as those lovely island-fringed
coasts that gave him birth;
and in describing battles he rushes on
himself to the charge, like some old
French-eating Marshal Blucher, the
incarnation of the whirlwind of battle
which he guides. Our German minstrel
takes matters more easily, and,
while his pen revels in blood, sits all
the while in his easy chair, rocking
himself delectably, and, like a true
German, smoking his pipe. His quiet
serene breadth is very apt to degenerate
into Westphalian flats and sheer
prosiness. When, again, he would
be sublime and stirring, as in the
bloody catastrophe, he is apt to overshoot
the mark, and becomes horrible.
His heroes are too gigantic, and do
things with a touch of their finger
which no Homeric hero would have
dreamt of without the help of a god.
The fancy, also, of the old German is
very barren and monotonous, as compared
with the wealthy Greek. His
similes are few; he has no richness
of analogy. Nevertheless, the Niebelungen
Lay remains for all Europe a
very notable poem&mdash;for all lovers of
popular poetry an indispensable study.
Whatever else it wants, it has nature
and health, simplicity and character
about it; and these things are always
pleasurable&mdash;sometimes, where
a taint of vicious taste has crept in,
your only curatives.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

HOW DICK DEVILSDUST WENT UPON HIS TRAVELS; HOW THE JUGGLER MADE A PACTION WITH
MOSES; AND HOW HE KEPT IT.</h3>

<p>You are, I suppose, perfectly
aware of what took place before Juggling
Johnny was appointed steward
of Squire Bull's household. The story
is not a pretty one; and, for the sake
of those who are dead and gone, I
shall not enter into particulars. Suffice
it that Johnny was installed in the
superintendence of the under-servants'
room through the influence of Dick
Devilsdust, Old Hum, the superannuated
Quack, Bendigo the fighting
Quaker, and a lot more of the same
set, who lived in the villages upon
the Squire's property, and bore anything
but goodwill to the steady and
peaceable tenants. Dick Devilsdust,
in particular, was a walking pestilence
to himself. For some reason or other,
which I could never fathom, he had
imbibed a most intense hatred to the
military, and never could set his eyes
upon a Redcoat without being thrown
into a horrible convulsion, and bellowing
like a bull at the sight of a Kilmarnock
nightcap. As he grew up,
he took to writing tracts between the
intervals of weaving; and one of his
first productions was an elaborate
defence of Esquire North, who was
then accused of having used harsh
measures towards one of his tenantry.
It is reported that Dick sent a copy
of this pamphlet to the Esquire, with
his humble compliments and so forth;
but whether that be true or no, certain
it is that he never received any
thanks, or so much as a stiver's acknowledgment
for having taken up
cudgels against poles&mdash;an omission
which, to the present day, he remembers
with peculiar bitterness. So
Dick thought it his best policy, as it
really was, to turn his attention to
the state of matters at home in Bullockshatch.
Dick, you must know,
dealt in a kind of cloth so utterly bad
that no tenant on the estate would
allow it to approach his skin. It was
stamped all over with great flaring
patterns of flamingos, parroquets, and
popinjays, such as no Christian could
abide the sight of; and if you took
one of his handkerchiefs to blow your
nose with, the odds are that its texture
was so flimsy that both your
fingers came through. He was therefore
obliged to sell it to people living
beyond the estate&mdash;Jews, Turks,
heretics or infidels, he did not care
whom, so that he could turn a penny;
and some of those benighted creatures,
having no other way of covering their
nakedness, were content to take his
rags, and to pay him handsomely for
them. For all that, Dick was a discontented
man. Did he meet a respectable
tenant of Squire Bull going
soberly with his family to church,
when he, Dick, was pretending to jog
to the meeting-house with his associates,
(though Obadiah refused to
certify that he was by any means a
regular attender,) he would make
mouths at the worthy man, and accost
him thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So, sir! going to the tithe-eating
parson's, I see&mdash;much good may it do
ye. And if ye don't happen to have
any particular sins this fine morning to
repent of, I may as well remind ye that
the quartern loaf is a farthing dearer
than it ought to be just at the present
time. Do you know what a locust is,
you clod? You're a cankerworm,
you base chawbacon!" And so on
he would go reviling the honest man,
who had all the mind in the world to
lay him on the broad of his back in
the mud&mdash;and would have done it too,
had it been a working week-day.
Another while, Dick would send the
bellman round the village, and having
called a special meeting of weavers
like himself, he would harangue them,
in some fashion like the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look'ye, my lads, I'm an independent
man and a weaver, and I
don't care a brass for Squire Bull.
I've got a seat in the under-servants'
room, and if I am not entitled to
make a row at meal-times I don't
know who is. I'll tell you a bit of
my mind&mdash;you're the worst-used set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of fellows on the face of the earth, and
if you have the least atom of pluck
you won't stand it. Here are you
obliged to take your flour from the
Squire's tenantry, when you might
get it cheaper if you went to the next
town and bought it from Nick Frog,
or Philip Baboon, or even Esquire
North; though I consider his name an
abomination, and would not give sixpence
to save him from perdition.
And then you have to find meal for
Dragon the house-dog, and to victual
some of the under servants; and it's
no joke, I can tell you, what they eat.
If you stand this any longer, you are
a set of jolterheads, and nincompoops,
and asses, and slaves, and base
cowardly coistrels. Why don't you
get up a stir, rouse the villages, and
alarm the tenantry a little? Rely
upon it, they will come to reason soon
enough if you give them a hint or two
about the duck-pond or the pump; and
for my own part, I don't mind telling
them so in the servants' hall."</p>

<p>And so he would go on, raving
and spouting, telling everybody that
Squire Bull was a superannuated
idiot, with not half the sense of his
natural bye-blow Jonathan&mdash;a chap
whom Dick quoted on all occasions&mdash;till
he got a kind of reputation as an
itinerant orator; and the tag-rag-and-bobtail
would come from any distance,
if they were certified that Devilsdust
was to give tongue.</p>

<p>Now, as to the grievance that Dick
complained of, there was none. The
tenantry, as you know, were obliged
to pay a pretty high rent to Squire
Bull for their farms, and to keep up
all sorts of watchmen and gamekeepers,
and rural police&mdash;besides a
night-patrol on the canal&mdash;not only
for the general security of the estate,
but for the order of the villages,
which hatched the most turbulent,
mischievous, and discontented crew
that ever an estate was cursed with.
When one of these fellows in the villages
fell ill, the tenantry were compelled
to pay for his nursing and cure.
When any of them were out of employment,
and lounging about the
market-place with their hands in
their breeches' pocket, not knowing
where to turn for a job, the tenantry,
out of sheer goodness of heart, gave
them a turn at ditching or draining;
and though they worked very ill they
got fair wages. More than two-thirds
of all the webs they wove&mdash;for some
of them were really skilful artisans,
and not mere botchers like Devilsdust&mdash;were
taken by John Bull's tenantry:
they paid almost no rent to the squire&mdash;in
fact, they were a great deal too
well treated, and this indulgence had
turned their heads. They wanted
now to have nothing to do with the
tenantry&mdash;beyond forcing them to
take the same amount of cloth as
before&mdash;and to get all their meat and
bread from Frog, Baboon, North,
Jonathan, and others, who lived off
the estate, and who, they thought,
would be uncommonly glad to take
webs in exchange for provisions.
None of these squires wanted webs,
because their own villagers would
have made a precious hullabaloo if
they had introduced into their estates
anything which was manufactured on
the grounds of Mr Bull; but they
made believe as if they would have
no objections, at some future period,
to meet the views of Devilsdust; and
in the mean time, having a good deal
of land which they wished to see properly
tilled, they intimated to the villagers
of Squire Bull, that they would
have no objection whatever to sell
them cattle and corn at a rate somewhat
smaller than Bull's tenantry
could afford.</p>

<p>This scheme never could have been
carried into effect but for a difference,
in the servants' hall. It is of no use
now raking up old matters. Carried
it was, to the great disgust of the
tenantry, and Juggling Johnny was
appointed steward. To do the Juggler
justice, he was not altogether in
favour of the plan. But he could
hardly help himself, as, without the
assistance of Dick and his backers,
he never would have got the keys;
so, being an adroit little creature,
and as clever at spinning a pirouette
as an opera-dancer, he turned
his back upon himself, declared
that the tenantry were labouring
under an antiquated fallacy, and that
he would put all to rights in the
twinkling of a bed-post. So, much
against the convictions of the Squire,
who knew him of old for as incapable
a squirrel as ever cracked a rotten
nut, he sat himself down at the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of the table, and began to talk to the
servants as though he were a second
edition of Mahomet or the prophet
Nixon.</p>

<p>And where do you think was Dick
Devilsdust all this time? If you
suppose that he was not looking after
his own interest, you are consumedly
mistaken. No sooner was the measure
which swindled Squire Bull's
tenantry carried in the servants' hall,
than he went down to the country,
called the villagers together, mounted
upon an old sugar-barrel&mdash;which was
now perfectly useless&mdash;and, brandishing
a billy-roller in his hand, addressed
them in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friends, Billy-roller men, and
brothers! lend me your ears! The
victory is won&mdash;we have done the
trick! Cottonchester and the Mississippi
are henceforward laid side by
side. (Enormous cheering.) The
devil take Bull's tenantry. (Applause.)
They are dolts, asses, fools, idiots,
chawbacons, and Helots. Bull himself
is a blockhead, and we must look
after his affairs. We alone, and not
the tenantry, are fit to do it.
(Cheering.) And I am not going to
stand any nonsense about police or
house-dogs. (Vociferous applause.)
We know very well why they are
kept; and I, for one, have no notion
of being interfered with. You understand
me? (Cries of "We do!")
Well, then, I'll tell you what it is&mdash;the
Juggler hasn't behaved to me at all
handsome in this matter. Not that I
care about it one toss of a Brummagem
farden; but I think they might have
paid a little more respect to the voice
of the villages. Howsom'dever, d'ye
see, I don't mind the thing; only, as
my health's a little shaken as it were
with doing jobs of yours, I think a
slight jaunt would do me good; and
as I have been obliged to neglect my
business, at an enormous sacrifice, on
your account, perhaps you wouldn't
consider it an unwarrantable liberty
if I were just to send round the hat."</p>

<p>So Devilsdust sent round the hat,
and pocketed a lot of browns with
some stray sixpences to boot&mdash;quite
enough in fact to clear him in his
projected jaunt, and something more.
This subscription&mdash;being the first&mdash;turned
out so well that Bendigo the
Quaker, who had been a strong
backer of Devilsdust, and, as some
thought, was the cleverer fellow of
the two, tried to get up a collection
on his own account; but, I am sorry
to say, made nothing of it. So
Devilsdust, having pocketed the blunt,
went out to take his holiday.</p>

<p>How do you think he used it? He
made what he called a "Practical
Tour" through the estates of Don
Pedro, Don Ferdinando, Signor Macaroni,
and Sultan Koran, advertising
his wares everywhere, and entreating
them to give him custom. Moreover,
he lost no opportunity of abusing his
landlord, John Bull, whom he held up
everywhere to contempt as the most
idiotical, prejudiced, pig-headed individual
living. He said that there was
but one way of promoting universal
brotherhood among all the estates,
and that was by admitting his, Dick
Devilsdust's, wares free of duty. He
pledged himself that, if this were done,
there would be no more squabbles or
lawsuits; and as he invariably spoke
in a dialect which no one who heard
him could understand, whilst he did
not understand one word which was
made in reply to his speeches, the
effect, of course, was electric. He
came back, swearing that there could
be no more lawsuits, on account of
his (Devilsdust's) enormous expected
consignments; and that all Bullockshatch
should unite as one man, to
compel Squire Bull to dismiss every
policeman, watchman, and bumbailiff
in his service. As for poor Dragon,
who had long been the terror of tramps
and poachers, Dick proposed that he
should be poisoned forthwith, or at
all events starved to death; but he
had not the smallest objection that
his skin should be stuffed, and preserved
as a specimen of an extinct
animal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Juggling Johnny, the
new steward, set about regulating the
affairs of the household as quietly as
possible. The Juggler was not now
quite so young as he once was, and,
moreover, he had taken unto himself
a wife; so that his wages became a
matter of considerable importance to
him, and he had no wish to do anything
which might induce Squire Bull
to give him warning. But he had
difficult cards to play. You must know
that the lower servants' room was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
fitted with an entirely new set, and a
number of these were fellows bred in
the villages, who were ready to say
ditto to every word which was uttered
by Devilsdust or Bendigo. They had
no abstract affection, but, on the
contrary, an intense contempt for the
Juggler, who they said&mdash;and perhaps
they had reason for it&mdash;was not
worth his wages; and they seemed to
make it the pet business of their lives
to keep him in hot water. One while
Hum, the quack doctor, would insist
on overhauling his accounts, and made
a tremendous outcry if every remnant
of candle was not accounted for. The
Juggler tried to stop his mouth by
giving his son an appointment in the
scullery, but old Hum, who was a
regular Greek, would not submit to be
put off in that way. Another while a
fellow would rise in the common's hall,
and quietly propose that the villagers
should, thenceforward, pay no rent to
the Squire. Some wanted to have
beer gratis; others complained that
they were not allowed to have their
stationery for nothing. In short,
there was no end to their clamour, so
that the Juggler very soon found that
he had by no means an easy seat.
Then there was another section of the
servants, friends of the regular tenantry,
who liked the Juggler just one
degree better than they liked Devilsdust
or Bendigo. They took every
opportunity of telling him that he was
playing the mischief with the whole
estate; that the rents were being paid
simply out of capital or borrowed
money, instead of profits; and that, if
he did not alter his whole system, and
clap on a decent embargo on the corn-carts
and meat-vans of Nick Frog,
North, Jonathan, and the rest, he
might wake some fine quarter-day
without finding money enough in the
till to pay himself his wages. That,
however, must have been an exaggeration,
for the Juggler was too old
a raven not to look ahead whenever
his own interest was concerned. The
only men who really stuck to him on
all occasions were such of the servants
as he could provide with places in the
household, or furnish with stray pickings
on the sly; and, to do them justice,
they adhered to him like leeches. The
upper servants, though they bore no
great love to Johnny, thought it best,
in the mean time, to interfere as little
as possible, and to let things run their
course; only this they were determined
upon, that no improper or suspected
person should get into the house without
their leave.</p>

<p>You may possibly think that the
Juggler could have no interest to break
this fundamental rule of the household,
but if so, you are confoundedly mistaken.
It was an old custom in Bullockshatch,
that nobody could be admitted
as a servant to the lower room
unless he should produce a certificate
from the village or farm from which
he came, to the effect that he was a
person of reasonably good character,
and unless he swore on the New
Testament that he would serve Squire
Bull faithfully. Now it so happened
that, when the Juggler went down to
the largest village on the estate to get
his certificate of character, he found,
very much to his petrifaction, that
Moses the old-clothesman, with three
hats upon his head, and a baize bag
for cast habiliments under his arm, had
put up a candidate of his own persuasion,
and was haranguing the villagers
in the market-place. Moses was, to say
the least of it, a doubtful kind of character.
Besides his ostensible calling,
and a minor though undisguised
traffic in oranges and sponges, he did
a little bit of underhand bill-broking
and discounting at most enormous percentages.
He was suspected, moreover,
of being the real owner of the
sponging-house, which was actually
kept by his nephew, to which all the
unhappy lads who were not prepared
to cash up when the bills became due
were carried, and fleeced out of their
watches, rings, and studs, or anything
else which they had about them. It
was said, moreover, that Moses was a
sweater and a slop-seller, and that he
was in the habit of kidnapping Christian
tailors who had gone astray, and
shutting them up under lock and key
in stifling garrets, where they were
compelled to work for him on the
smallest possible allowance of cabbage,
without a slice of cucumber to
flavour it. One thing there was no
doubt of, that, by some means or other,
Moses had become enormously rich,
so that he was able to lend money to
any of the neighbouring squires who
might require it, and it was strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
surmised that he even held bonds with
the signature of John Bull appended.</p>

<p>You may fancy, from this description
of him, that Moses was by no
means popular; nor was he. But
money will go a great way, and the
truth is, that he had so many of the
villagers under his power that they
durst not say a word against him.
Then, again, he had made friends with
Obadiah, to whom he talked about
liberty of conscience, and so forth;
dropping, at the same time, a five-pound
note on the floor, and pretending
not to notice that Obadiah's splay
foot covered it by an instantaneous
instinct. So they parted on the best
of terms, Moses calling Obadiah
"ma tear" as they shook hands, and
Obadiah snuffling something about
"a chosen vessel." After that they
thoroughly understood one another,
though Obadiah did not altogether
give up his old trick of soliciting the
ladies for a subscription to convert
Moses&mdash;the proceeds whereof never
reached the latter, at least under the
persuasive form of hard cash.</p>

<p>Great, therefore, was the astonishment
of the Juggler when he found
Moses speaking in the market-place,
and Obadiah cheering him with all
his might and main. He would gladly
have slunk off, if he had been
allowed the opportunity of doing so;
but Obadiah was too quick for him.</p>

<p>"Here's a dispensation!" cried our
lank-haired acquaintance, the moment
he caught a glimpse of the Juggler's
wrinkled mug passing round the corner
of the lane. "Here's a special
vouchsafing, and a jubilation, and a
testimony&mdash;ha, hum! Make way
there, you brother in the fustian
jacket! and you fellow-sinner in the
moleskins, take your pipe out of
your cheek, and let pass that Saul
among the people!"&mdash;and before he
knew where he was, the Juggler
was hoisted on the shoulders of the
rabble, and passed on to the hustings,
where he found himself placed cheek-by-jowl
with Moses and Obadiah,
and every kind of money-lender and
usurer, and hypocritical frequenter of
the Stocks, clustering around him, and
wringing his hand, as though they
had loved him from infancy.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Juggling Johnny,
the friend of liberty of conscience!"
cried one&mdash;"Huzza for the Juggler
and anythingarianism!" vociferated
a second&mdash;"Down with Christendom!"
roared a third&mdash;"Make him
free of the Synagogue!" suggested a
fourth&mdash;"Three groans for Martin!"
shouted a fifth&mdash;"Schent per schent!"
screamed a sixth; and, finally, they
all agreed upon one chorus, and rent
the welkin with acclamations for
Moses and the Juggler.</p>

<p>You may easily conceive that the
latter was anything but delighted at
this demonstration. He had a proud
stomach of his own, and was woundily
disgusted to find that he was only
considered as playing the second fiddle
to the old-clothesman. But nevertheless
he durst not, for the life of
him, show any symptoms of vexation;
so he stepped to the front of the hustings
with a grin on his face, as though
he had been fortifying himself for the
task with a dram of verjuice, and
began to speechify as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friends, and enlightened villagers!
your reception of me this day
is the proudest criterion of my life.
Unaccustomed as I am to public
speaking, yet, on this occasion, when
liberty of conscience is the grand climacteric
menstruum which depends
upon the scale, I would be unworthy
the name of a thorough indigenous
renovator if I did not express, by all
the judicious idiosyncrasy in my power,
the deep aspirations which vibrate in
my unfathomed sensorial region. Yes,
my friends, it is true! liberty of
conscience is liberty of conscience;
and the man who denies that proud
and exalted position is, to my mind,
no better than a mere residuary instigator.
As the progress of opinion
moves forward, so move its chariot
wheels; sometimes unseen amidst the
roar of popular ebullition, but never
the less distinctly, that the clear calm
voice of conscience illustrates the oscillations
of the heart, and marks,
beyond the possibility of doubt, those
unequivocal demonstrations which
control the destiny of empires. Holding
such opinions, as I have ever held
them&mdash;relying upon the quantification
of the predicate which dictates irrevocably
to the sublime and recondite
motion of the spheres&mdash;and appealing,
moreover, to my own past experience,
and your knowledge of my consistorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
qualifications, I have little hesitation
or dubiety, at the present juncture,
of claiming your senatorial suffrages
to the proud position which I trust I
am redintegrated to occupy!"</p>

<p>At this, some few fellows at the
outskirts of the crowd began to cheer;
and Johnny, taking advantage of the
circumstance, made them a polite
bow, and was about to skip off without
further question. But a big bumbailiff,
who was an intimate friend of
Moses, stopped him at once.</p>

<p>"Lookye, master Juggler!" said he,
"all this may be very well, and, for
my part, I've no manner of objection
to make to your principles. They
might be a thought clearer, perhaps,
but that's neither here nor there.
But what we want to hear from you
is this&mdash;will you stand by Moses at
this pinch, and lend his friend a
helping hand to get into the servants'
hall?"</p>

<p>It was pitiable to see how the Juggler
twisted and turned. He had a
mouth's mind to say no to the whole
concern; but he knew very well that,
if he did so, the villagers would have
nothing to say to him. For there
were two public-houses in the market-place
decorated with flags, inscribed
with such mottos as "Moses for
ever!" and "Vote for the Talmud
and liberty of conscience!" and
through the open windows you could
see scores of fellows within, guzzling
beer and gin, and smoking tobacco&mdash;all,
as you may suppose, at the expense
of the old-clothesman. So the
Juggler, seeing that he had no chance
of getting a character there, unless he
made common interest with Moses,
stepped up to the latter, called him
his excellent friend and beloved pitcher,
and said he hoped very soon to
welcome his nominee to servants' hall.</p>

<p>"Only," quoth he, "you must be
prepared for some of the fellows yonder
kicking up a bobbery about that
idle matter of the oath. However, I
think we shall be quite able to manage
that: one book is just as good as
another, and I do suppose your friend
will have no objection to be sworn on
the Song of Solomon?"</p>

<p>So they shook hands again, and the
mob shouted, and then both the Juggler
and the friend of Moses got their
characters certified by the village
schoolmaster. There was talk at the
time of a private arrangement made
between them, whereby Moses undertook
to stand the whole expense of the
beer; but as I never saw a copy of the
document, I won't be positive as to
that.</p>

<p>But what, think you, took place
after this? One fine afternoon, when
the servants were sitting at their
commons, up gets the Juggler, and proposes
that they should agree to let in
his excellent friend and colleague of
the tribe of Moses, without taking the
usual oath. Whereupon a great row
commenced&mdash;one English, an old servant
of the Squire, and an especial
friend of Martin's, protesting that he
would not sit at the same table with
an arch-heathen and unbeliever; and
many others did the same. However,
Bendigo, Devilsdust, Hum
and Company, this time backed up
the Juggler, and a majority of the
under-servants were for letting him
in. This, however, they could not
do without the consent of the upper-servants,
who very coolly told them
that they would do nothing of the sort;
and that Moses and his friends, if they
refused to take the oath, might even
wait at the outside of the door. When
this was communicated to Moses and
his tribe, they were in a sad taking.
However, they sent word to the
Juggler that they relied upon his
making another attempt; and in the
mean time they got Obadiah to go
out to the lanes and bye-ways, and
preach sermons in favour of Moses.
But nobody cared, in reality, one
single stiver for Moses. The very
villagers, who had drunk his beer,
refused to do anything further in the
matter; and the Juggler, seeing this,
thought it best to hold his tongue
and imitate their example. At last
Moses and his friends began to wax
furious, and to abuse the Juggler as
a traitor, time-server, slippery rogue,
and so forth; and some of the more
pestilent of the under-servants went
down to the village, and persuaded
Moses for once to pluck up heart,
and boldly to knock at the gate in
his own person, demanding admittance.
"Time enough," said they,
"to boggle about the oath when they
put it to you."</p>

<p>So Moses, having figged himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
out in a sky-blue satin vest, with
peach-coloured trousers, and a velveteen
cut-away coat, and no end of
Mosaic jewellery, went up to the
door, and, when the porter came to
see who was there, attempted, with
the utmost effrontery, to walk in and
help himself to the table-beer. But
English was too quick for him.</p>

<p>"Halloa, there!" he cried; "what
right has that fellow to come here?
Has he taken the oath?" Whereupon
Moses admitted that he had not, but
that he was perfectly ready, if the gentleman
pleased, to qualify himself upon
the Apocrypha! At this up starts the
Juggler, and, to the infinite consternation
of Moses, desires that he shall
be shown to the outside of the door,
until this matter was discussed. This
being done, the row began afresh.
Some of the servants said that Moses
should be admitted at once upon his
simple affirmation; but the Juggler,
who had by this time taken a second
thought on the subject, would not
hear of it. So he proposed that they
should adopt a string of resolutions,
to the effect that Moses was an
excellent character, and well qualified
to be a servant of the Squire's,
but that neither he nor any of his
persuasion could be admitted without
complying with the rules of
the household, and that the matter
must just lie over. "And this, I
think," said the Juggler, "will be a
noble testimony of our respect for the
liberty of the conscience, and also in
entire conformity with the customs of
the household." At this Hum and
others got up in a rage, and said&mdash;what
was true enough&mdash;that it was
no testimony at all, but a wretched
piece of shuffling; and that the
Juggler ought to be ashamed to show
his face in decent society, considering
the nature of his previous encouragements
and promises to Moses. But,
nevertheless, there the matter ended
for the time; and Moses, when he
was informed of the resolution, uttered
a melancholy howl of "Old clo'!"
shouldered his bag, and from that
day to this has never been allowed to
put his nose within the door.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

HOW PHILIP BABOON WAS EJECTED FROM HIS ESTATE&mdash;HOW COLONEL MARTINET BAMBOOZLED HIS
TENANTRY&mdash;AND HOW THE ROW BECAME GENERAL.</h3>

<p>But I must go back a little, and
tell you what was doing in other
estates which are adjacent to the
Squire's. Philip Baboon, who, as
you may remember, had succeeded in
ousting his cousin Charles, who was
the natural proprietor of the estate,
was as deep an old fox as ever established
himself in a badger's burrow.
He contrived to marry his sons and
daughters&mdash;and a precious lot he had
of them&mdash;into the best families in
the neighbourhood; and whenever a
new match of this kind was concluded,
what, think you, did he, but call
upon his tenantry to come down with
a handsome sum, just by way of
gratuity, to set up the young couple
in the world! Nor could he plead
personal poverty as an excuse for
this; for it was notorious to everybody
that he was the richest old fellow
in Christendom, and regularly
spent several hours each day in his
closet counting over his coin by sackfuls.
In a short while, his own
people began to detest him cordially,
so that at last he could hardly go
out to take an airing, without being
startled by the whiz of a bullet past
his ear; and he durst not even open
a letter without precaution, lest it
should be filled with fulminating
powder. When he first came into
the estate, he was considered rather
a hearty old buck than otherwise;
for he used to drive about in a
pony phaeton, popping into cottages
about meal-time, tasting the
soup-maigre, and patting the children
on the head, though he never
was known to give them as much
coin as might purchase a penny
trumpet. But now all that was
changed. He had grown morose and
gloomy, never stirred abroad, and
maintained a large body of police for
the purpose of guarding the premises.
It is quite possible that he might
have kept possession to his dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
day, but for one of the most stupid
acts of interference that was ever
committed by a master. It so happened
that some of the servants
had agreed to dine together on a holiday,
and as each man was to pay his
own shot, there could be no reasonable
objection. But what think ye
did Philip Baboon? No sooner did
he hear the clatter of the dishes, than
he peremptorily forbade the servants
to sit down to their meal, telling them
that, if they ventured to do so, he
would have them all taken into custody.
This was rather too much; so,
next morning, when Philip came out
of his dressing-room, what should he
find but a huge barricade of tables,
chairs, washing-tubs, and what not,
erected at the head of the principal
staircase, and fifty or sixty of the
very worst fellows from the village&mdash;poachers,
ragmen, and coal-heavers&mdash;armed
with pikes and cudgels, cursing,
swearing, and hurrahing like mad.
And, what was worse than that, some
of the regular servants were backing
them up. No sooner did they catch
a glimpse of Philip than they set up
a yell which might have done credit
to a colony of Choctaws, and let
drive a perfect storm of chamberpots
and other crockery at his head.
Philip jumped back into his dressing-room
in an ecstasy of terror, bolted
the door, threw up the window, and
screamed lustily for the police. But
the police were not one whit more to
be relied upon than their neighbours,
for they only nodded and laughed, but
did not budge a foot; and instead of
collaring the scoundrels, who were by
this time swarming round the doors,
they accosted them as excellent
friends and beloved brethren, and
drank their very good healths, and
success to them, out of pots of beer
which some of the servants had supplied.
When Philip Baboon saw that,
he knew it was all up with him; so,
having caught up as many valuables
as he could well carry, he even stole
down the back staircase, and made off,
leaving his family to shift for themselves
as they best could. In fact,
the fright which he got had altogether
upset his reason. He skulked about
the woods for several days, assuming
all sorts of disguises, and sleeping at
night in barns; and at length crossed
the ferry and landed on Squire Bull's
estate, as cold and tattered as a scarecrow.</p>

<p>As for Philip's house, after he left
it, it became a regular bedlam. The
doors were thrown wide open, and
every tatterdemalion on the estate
rushed in, whooping, hallooing, and
yelling, as though they had been at
Donnybrook fair. First, they broke
open Philip's cellar, and helped themselves
to his best wines and spirits;
next, they went up to the bedrooms,
smoked in the beds, and committed
divers other abominations which it is
not needful to detail; then, they took
his best furniture, heaved it out of the
windows, and made a bonfire of it in
the court. In short, they acted for
some time like regular madmen&mdash;the
servants standing by and looking on,
but not daring to interfere. Indeed,
it was questionable what right they
had to interfere, if they were never so
willing to do it; for the estate was
now without an owner, and the mob
had sworn a most horrible oath, that
no one of the blood of Charles or
Philip Baboon should again set foot
within the property. However, some
of the wiser and steadier of the old
servants saw plainly enough that these
disorders must be put a stop to in
some way or other, and that the house
at all events must be cleared of the
rabble; "otherwise," thought they,
"it will be burned to the ground, or
thoroughly gutted, and in that case
there is little chance that our boxes
can escape." So they issued an order
that everybody should leave the
house, thanking, at the same time, in
the most polite terms, the exceedingly
respectable gentlemen who had taken
the trouble to assist them in getting
rid of old Philip. Then it was that
they got a sufficient taste of the quality
of the fellows with whom they
had to deal. No sooner was the order
posted up in the different rooms than
it was torn down, amidst the hooting
of the mob, who swore that they
were the sole proprietors of the estate
and the house, and everything in it,
and that they would not submit to be
dictated to by a parcel of superannuated
lackeys and footmen. Nay, it
was enough to make the hair of any
respectable tradesman turn grey on
the spot to hear the language which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
they used. They said that no man
had a right to keep any property to
himself, but that every one was entitled
by the laws of nature to help
himself to whatever he fancied. They
averred that the boy of all work, who
swept out the shop of a morning and
ran the errands, was entitled to demand
a half share of all his master's
profits; and these damnable heresies,
they said, they were determined to
enforce in future. So you may easily
conceive the taking in which all people
were on the estate who had a
Sunday's suit of clothes, a stick of
furniture, or, mayhap, a bag of
money.</p>

<p>In short, matters proceeded from
bad to worse, and at last became
so intolerable that three or four of the
old servants, who had contrived to
keep a garret to themselves, sent for
one Budge, who had been chief constable
in Philip Baboon's time, and
told him plainly that, unless he could
assist them in turning out this villanous
crew, everything must necessarily
go to wreck and ruin. Budge was an
old soldier, who had seen service&mdash;a
devilish determined kind of fellow
when he took any job in hand, and
not at all in the habit of sticking at
trifles. It was more than whispered
that, if Philip Baboon had not lost
head altogether at the first brush, but
been capable of giving orders, Budge
would have stood by him; and such
was his influence over the police that
there is no saying what might have
been the result.</p>

<p>As it was, he heard them to the
end without uttering a word, and
then, taking the pipe from his mouth,
and knocking out the ashes on the
hob, he delivered himself in the following
oracular fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Harkye, mounseers! If so be as
how you want the job done, and them
raff utterly scomfished, I'm the man
that can do it. The force will stick
to me, because I sticks to the force.
Moreover, they knows by this time
that there ain't no chance of their
getting their pay so long as this shindy
is allowed. They're ready, and I'm
ready. Only this&mdash;I is to be allowed
to do as I likes. I takes my orders
from you, and them orders is to be,
that I may shoot, hang, or blow up
every scoundrel who stands in my
way. Them's my terms; and the
sooner you puts it down on black and
white the better!"</p>

<p>As there was no help for it, the servants
gave Budge the order; whereupon
he stepped down to the courtyard,
called the police together, and told
them that if they did not obey his
directions, not one mother's son of
them would see a halfpenny of their
arrears. He then reminded them,
that, if the blackguards who held possession
of the house got the upper
hand, the force would inevitably be
discharged, and most of them thrown
upon the parish, the poor-rates being
no longer collected. They were all
ready enough to join him; but they
became readier still, when, just as he was
speaking, a quantity of filth was
thrown upon them from a window
above, followed by the hootings and
laughter of the drunken gang who
were sotting away as usual. Budge
did not lose his opportunity; but,
beckoning to his men to follow, he
took them to an adjoining cellar,
where there were plenty blunderbusses
and small-arms collected, and having
given each watchman twelve rounds
of ammunition and a dram, he bade
them fear nothing, but proceed to
clear the premises.</p>

<p>It was not so easy a task as you
might imagine. Many of the desperadoes
within had weapons, and were
determined to use them, so that a
bloody fight took place at the staircase,
where the barricades were again
thrown up. But the police, being in
grim earnest, fought this time like
devils, and at last succeeded in clearing
the house, and in capturing several
of the ringleaders, who were incontinently
shaved in the head, and sent
off to hard labour in the hulks. In
this way some sort of order was
restored; and at last, by the general
voice of the tenantry, young Nap, a
nephew of the old Corsican who had
once given Squire Bull so much
trouble, was made provisional head-steward
of the estate, and remains so
to the present day. Budge died shortly
afterwards&mdash;whether or not from
exertion in the above affair I cannot
say&mdash;and the number of the police
was doubled, much, as you may suppose,
to the disgust of the malcontents,
who have not yet abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the idea of a second attack upon the
house.</p>

<p>One squib suffices to set off a whole
bundle; and you can have no idea
what effect these proceedings on
Baboon's territory had upon some
neighbouring estates. Nick Frog's
people, to be sure, both tenantry and
villagers, expressed themselves perfectly
contented with their landlord;
but a very different scene occurred on
the domain of Colonel Martinet. The
Colonel&mdash;who was usually considered
as rather out at elbows&mdash;had an immense
notion of his own importance,
and wanted, at county meetings and
elsewhere, to take the precedence of
Don Ferdinando, whose lands were
twice the extent of his, besides being
incomparably in finer order. This sort
of rivalry had led to many bickerings
in former years, though the two were
cousins-german; and these were heightened
by the fact that, at the Quarter-Sessions,
which they both attended,
some thirty small proprietors and yeomen
were entitled to vote. Ferdinando
had hitherto been invariably elected
chairman, a dignity which Martinet
would have given his little finger to
achieve; indeed, so much store did he
set on gaining it that he kept up an
establishment far too costly for his
means, and, in consequence, took
every opportunity of driving a hard
bargain with his tenantry. Not that
he was illiberal&mdash;at least so he said.
He was exceedingly desirous that his
tenantry should have an opportunity
of inspecting the manner in which his
accounts were kept; but, somehow or
other, he never would give them that
opportunity, and great were the complaints
in consequence. Privately&mdash;there
is no use mincing the matter&mdash;the
Colonel was a weak creature. He
had got into an unfortunate habit of
issuing orders and then recalling
them, solely for the purpose of exhibiting
the extent of his puissance
and power. The consequence was
that you never could depend upon
him. At eleven o'clock he would
summon his servants, and deliver to
them a document regularly signed and
sealed, desiring a meeting of the tenantry
to be held next day, at which he
would announce to them a material
remission of rent. Right or wrong,
that must be posted instantly. At one,
he had changed his mind; the meeting
was to be put off, and he intended
to charge them twenty per cent additional.
At three, there was a new
notice, desiring them, under penalties,
to attend a Protestant place of worship.
At five, out came a placard
warning them to conform to the
Roman Catholic religion. And if no
more notices were given that day, the
reason was that the Colonel had
gone to dinner. You may therefore
comprehend the reason why his people,
when they learned what had befallen
Philip Baboon, thought it a good
opportunity to do likewise, and, at
all events, to demand a sight of the
books.</p>

<p>It so happened that, when they
assembled, the Colonel was in one
of his exalted moods; and, on being
informed that a large body of men
were gathering on the lawn, he immediately
gave orders to the gamekeepers
to fire upon them. This they accordingly
did; and you may conceive the
consternation and rage of the poor
fellows, who had their faces tattooed
with snipe-shot! They retreated, but
returned in an hour or two afterwards
in augmented numbers, seriously determined
on mischief, when, what
think you took place? Why, the
Colonel, having in the mean time
finished another bottle, came out to
meet them in a full suit of black, with
crape round his hat, and weepers on
his wrists, protesting that the whole
thing was a mistake&mdash;that he loved
them as his life&mdash;that they were his
children, (which might have been the
case with some half-dozen of them)&mdash;and
that, if any of them were going
to die from the unfortunate accident
of the discharge, he, Colonel Martinet,
would be proud and happy to officiate
as principal mourner! While they
stood staring like stuck pigs at this
unexpected announcement, the Colonel
began an oration lauding them
mightily as the best and foremost
tenantry in the universe, protesting
that it was a shame and disgrace that
they were not allowed to take the wall
of Ferdinando's tenants, and hinting
that it merely depended upon themselves
whether they might not get
new lands for nothing.</p>

<p>"At all events, my lads," said he,
"one thing is clear&mdash;we must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the precedence at Quarter-Sessions.
Your honour is concerned in that, as
well as mine; and I don't see why
we should not have a tidy little court
of our own, chosen generally by all
the tenantry, to put matters right,
and settle any trifling matters of dispute.
Don't say one word of apology
for what has occurred to-night. I
understand the whole matter. Don
Ferdinando is at the bottom of the
whole mischief, but we'll make him
pay for it before long. Is there anything
more? I think not. Well then,
gentlemen, I insist upon your having
a glass of wine all round; and, if
you please, we shall drink bad luck to
Ferdinando and his tenants!"</p>

<p>You would hardly believe it; but
the mob did actually drink the toast,
and gave a cheer for the Colonel moreover,
and then went peaceably home.
But the question about the Quarter-Sessions
was by no means settled.
Some men held the opinion that neither
Ferdinando nor Colonel Martinet
had any right to dictate in person, but
the whole bench should be composed
of persons elected by the tenantry and
villagers, independent of the landlords;
and, for that purpose, they convened
a meeting at the Frankfort Arms&mdash;a
sort of joint-stock public-house, to
which everybody who lived on the
estates represented at Quarter-Sessions
might come and welcome&mdash;to
consider what rents should be paid,
and what police maintained, and a
variety of questions which were utterly
beyond their province to decide. Nor
had they the sense even to take this
step without causing a new outcry,
for they summoned to their meeting
men from a farm belonging to the
estate of Squire Copenhagen, and
which had belonged to it since the
days of Noah, on the pretext that the
flood had unrighteously separated it
from their jurisdiction at Quarter-Sessions!</p>

<p>No sooner were they assembled at
the Frankfort Arms than they declared
the meeting to be perpetual,
and voted themselves each a handsome
allowance of five shillings per
diem at the expense of the landlords;
some of whom, like Martinet, paid
their share of the subsidy because
they could not well help themselves,
whilst others, like Ferdinando, told
the rascals who called with the subscription-book
to go to the devil.
Then they set about drawing up new
regulations for the management of all
the neighbouring estates, of which
they now considered themselves the
actual proprietors, calling the landlords
mere trustees, and declaring
that they would make them account
strictly for past intromissions. Next,
they ordered out a posse of watchmen
and gamekeepers, and sent them down
the river to occupy that farm of
Squire Copenhagen's of which we
have spoken, with the full consent of
Martinet, who had long had an eye
upon it for his own advantage. But
they reckoned for once without their
host, for Copenhagen was as brave as
a lion, and determined to fight to the
last drop of his blood before an acre
of his estate should be confiscated;
and Esquire North, who was a near
relation of his, intimated that he
should be ready at all times to back
him in his reasonable quarrel.</p>

<p>If I were to tell you all that took
place in consequence of the proceedings
of this villanous gang at the
Frankfort Arms, it would occupy
volumes. There were no bounds to
the disturbances which they created.
They were drunk from morning till
night, and might be seen staggering
about in dresses which made them
facsimiles of the ruffians who murdered
the Babes in the Wood. They
shouted, and wrangled, and fought,
and blasphemed, until no peaceable
gentleman durst go near the Frankfort
Arms, lest he should be assaulted,
attacked, or robbed; and at last they
grew so bad that they were indicted
as a common nuisance. Martinet,
and those who had hitherto supported
them, gave notice that the supplies
were stopped; and so, after a scene of
rioting which baffles all description,
they were turned neck and crop out
of doors, and the Frankfort Arms
was shut up. Some of the vagabonds,
not knowing what better to do,
marched in a body and broke into
Ferdinando's mansion&mdash;a feat which
they accomplished with the aid of
the charity boys on his foundation,
for those diabolical miscreants had
poisoned the minds and perverted the
principles of old and young. There
they remained for some days, plundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and ravishing; but were at last
driven out again by Ferdinando and his
watchmen, who, as you may well suppose,
felt no manner of scruple whatever
in knocking the ringleaders on
the head.</p>

<p>These, however, were only part of
the disturbances which took place, for
there was more or less rioting in almost
every estate in the country;
even Bullockshatch did not altogether
escape, as you shall presently hear.
Indeed, many excellent people began
to think that the end of the world
must be drawing nigh, for such was
the beating of drums, blowing of trumpets,
springing of rattles, yelling of
mobs, and alarms of fire every night,
that no amount of laudanum could
insure a quiet slumber.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

OF THE ATTEMPTED DISTURBANCES AT BULLOCKSHATCH; OF THE OUTBREAK ON THE FARM AT THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE POND; AND OF THE GRADUAL ADVANCES OF PETER.</h3>

<p>The news of the ejection of Philip
Baboon by the tenantry and villagers
spread, as you may suppose, like
wildfire all over Bullockshatch, and
was also soon conveyed to John's
detached farm on the other side of the
pond. Now, although the greater part
of the tenantry had little confidence
in the Juggler, and others who occupied
situations in the household, they
were deeply and sincerely attached to
John, and were ready to stand by him
to the last drop of their blood. And
so, to do them justice, were the vast
majority of the villagers who had
money in the Savings' Bank: for, besides
the fact that the Squire was a
kind, upright, and honourable master
as ever breathed the breath of life,
they knew that, if anything should
happen to him, they might whistle
for their principal, let alone the yearly
dividends. But there was a set of
rascals, the same who for years past
had been attempting to batter down
the Ten-bar Gate which was put up
by old Gray and the Juggler in the
Squire's avenue, who thought this a
capital opportunity to create a fresh
disturbance; so they met at a pothouse
hard by, constituted themselves
into a kind of sham servants' hall,
passed resolutions to the effect that
they were entitled to occupy the
house, and to have the run of the
buttery; and in secret set about the
purchase of crowbars, picklocks, and
other implements of burglary. This,
however, was not done so secretly
but that a rumour of it reached the
ears of the Juggler, who grew as pale
as death at the intelligence, and
could hardly be brought round by dint
of sal-volatile and burned feathers.
When he came to himself, and had
thought over the subject, he began to
see that he was in an ugly fix. None
of his own friends were fit to manage
an affair of this kind, so he resolved to
take what was precisely the wisest
course he could have adopted, namely,
to step across the way, and take
counsel with old Arthur, who still retained
a sort of superintendence of the
police. He found the gallant veteran
with spectacles on nose, reading
C&aelig;sar's <i>Commentaries</i>; and being accommodated
with a camp-stool, the
Juggler even made a clean breast of
it, and laid his difficulties before him.
Arthur pricked up his ears like a
horse at the sound of the hunting-horn.</p>

<p>"Leave this matter entirely to me,
Master Juggler!" quoth he. "It
concerns the safety of the whole household;
and it shan't be said that old
Arthur hung back at the last, after
having served Squire Bull so long.
In the mean time, go you and enrol as
many tight lads as you can for special
constables; I'll look after the police,
and take care to have Dragon the
house-dog ready."</p>

<p>So the Juggler hopped down stairs
with a heart as light as a linnet's, for
he knew that if Arthur took a job in
hand it was as good as done. And
before evening a whole regiment of
tight lads were sworn as special constables.
Arthur was at work all
night, and, by daybreak, everything
was ready. Pattereroes were mounted
on the roofs of the outhouses, so as to
command the avenue; the regular
police was mustered in the Riding-School,
and Dragon's collar ready to
be slipped at a moment's notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>The mob, however, did not venture
to appear. They had summoned a
great meeting to be held on a common,
from which they were to march
upon John's house; but the hearts
of many failed them when they
heard tell of the preparations which
were made for their reception, and
they did not appear at the place of
muster. In fact, the whole thing
ended in smoke. The meeting on the
common broke up. Nobody appeared
at the gate save one red-headed
fellow, who came trundling a wheelbarrow
before him, which he said contained
the humble petition of many
well-affected villagers; and he requested,
quite meekly, that he might
be allowed to convey it to the house.
No objection whatever was made to
this&mdash;so the barrow, escorted by special
constables, was wheeled up the
avenue, and the petition carried into
the house, and laid upon the servant's
table. When they came to examine
it, however, they found what a set of
rascals the framers were. "John
Bull, his mark," was subscribed at
least fifty times to the petition addressed
to himself! Mrs Bull appeared
to have done little else for a fortnight
than go about from booth to pothouse
for the purpose of signing her
name! If there was faith in pen, ink,
and paper, Arthur had committed
himself twenty times over, and so had
the Juggler, and almost every one of
the servants. Then there were names
like Bloody-bones, Dirk Hatteraick,
Blue-beard, and Swill-gore, which
were never borne by any Christian
man, in hundreds; so that it became
apparent that it was no petition at
all, but an infamous forgery; and it
was accordingly chucked under the
table. And so ended this new conspiracy
at Bullockshatch.</p>

<p>Matters, however, looked more serious
on the farm on the other side of
the pond, which had always harboured
the most turbulent set of people on
the whole estate. That hoary old
sinner, Peter, of whom you shall hear
more anon, had been allowed, through
the stupidity, carelessness, or good-nature
of some of the former stewards,
to take such liberties there, that at
last he had the consummate impudence
to assert that he, and not
Squire Bull, was the Lord Paramount.
He even appointed deputies, who
claimed a sort of jurisdiction; and if
he did not venture actually to uplift
the rents, he hinted broadly enough
that nobody was bound in conscience
to pay them to the Squire, or to render
stipend to Patrick, who acted as
the Squire's chaplain in those parts.
Dan, the old Rabiator, as he was
called, had been long his chief agent
in the farm; but Dan was now dead,
and the man who assumed his place
was little better than a nincompoop.
Nobody, in fact, could have done
Peter's business half so well as Dan.
He always kept&mdash;at least almost always&mdash;on
the windy side of the law;
talked wildly enough, in all conscience,
but abstained from overt acts; and
knew precisely how to avail himself
of the necessities of the steward for
the time being, who was often forced
to apply to him for a helping hand in
cases of strong emergency. In this
way Dan was able to provide handsomely
for his family, most of whom
were located in different situations of
indifferent trust in the service of
Squire Bull; and he managed, moreover,
to secure a snug little income
for himself, by levying a kind of
black-mail, called Daniel's pence, at
all the fairs and gatherings on the
farm. But when Dan died, he left no
Elisha behind him. One Byrne tried
to put on his mantle&mdash;a sorry one it
was by this time&mdash;and he insisted
that all the disciples of Peter, and all
others on the farm who bore no goodwill
to the Squire, were bound to follow
him, on the ground that, before
the Christian era, an ancestor of his
was supposed to have possessed a
corner of the farm rent-free. He had
a seat in the under servants' hall, but
he refused to attend at commons,
alleging that he did not get as much
as he was entitled to; and, after
several acts of foolery, he fairly
crossed over to the farm, and called
upon Donnybrook and Shilelah, and
the other merry lads who used to roar
in the wake of Dan, to follow him,
and knock the constables of the Squire
on the head. A bigger fool than
Byrne you never met with on a summer's
day. His game evidently was
to have played Peter's cards, to keep
temporising whenever he could, and
to have done all in his power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
advance the interests of that stealthy
Jesuit. Peter would have backed
him to any extent, so long as he stood
up solely for the interests and the
rights of Peter; but the moment he
deserted that principle, and advanced
his own preposterous claims, he found
the back of Peter's hand turned to
him with a vengeance. A sad sight
it was to see the poor fellow take to
the hill-side, with a handful of misbegotten
idiots behind him, dressed in a
new uniform ordered for the occasion,
and carrying pikes and rusty swords,
and pokers, and such other weapons
as they could conveniently command.
They had not even victuals enough to
sustain them for the first twelve hours
of their march; and whenever they
knocked at the door of any of Peter's
emissaries, imploring that, for the
love of the saints, he would hand
them out a bowlful of potatoes, they
were greeted with a formal commination,
and told that they were accursed
heretics. They tried to storm a tollhouse
or two, for the purpose of abstracting
money; but they invariably
found the shutters made fast, and
divers fowling-pieces levelled at them
from the windows of the upper story.
At last, after being out for four or
five nights in the cold mist and rain,
they came down to a house kept by a
lone widow woman, in which several
of the police were stationed, and
swore that, if they were not admitted,
they would burn down the premises,
and massacre every man, woman, and
child within. Possibly they never
intended to do anything of the kind;
for Byrne, though a blockhead, had
nothing savage about him; indeed,
he was rather soft-hearted than otherwise.
He ran round the house, entreating
the police to surrender, in
order to save the effusion of blood;
but they merely answered by a laugh
of contempt, and a discharge of musketry,
which was supposed to have
settled Byrne's business. However,
his followers, on looking about, found
him squatted in the widow's cabbage-garden,
marvellously distressed in
heart, and apparently labouring under
a painful visitation of the bowels.
He escaped for the moment, but a
few days afterwards was seized, tried,
and sentenced to transportation. And
this is the last actual outbreak which
has occurred in any portion of Squire
Bull's estates.</p>

<p>But you must not, from this, conclude
that everything was going
smooth. That infernal miscreant,
Peter, had acted politicly throughout
the latter affair; not from any regard
to Squire Bull, but because he knew
he could make more of him by seeming
to give into his authority, than by
backing up a stupid egotistical creature
like Byrne, who never had the
ghost of a chance. Now, however,
when the danger was over, he,
through his emissaries, thought fit to
claim prodigious credit for the disinterested
part which he had acted.
One Claretson was at this time
ground-steward for the Squire on that
farm, and to him the whole retainers
of Peter repaired.</p>

<p>"You see," they said, "what immense
respect we have for the authority
of Squire Bull. Nothing would
have been easier for us than to have
set up Byrne; but our consciences
would not allow it; and so we have
settled what might have been an ugly
business without any difficulty at all.
We don't wish to claim the slightest
merit for having done so. It was
our duty, and nothing more. Merely,
if you think that we deserve well of
Squire Bull, we would just mention
that certain of Patrick's people are
apt to give themselves airs, and to
insist upon walking before us out of
a shebeen-shop, which is neither here
nor there, only it is unpleasant, considering
that many of us and our predecessors
maintain that we were in
the parishes before Patrick was born.
That, we allow, may possibly be
matter of dispute; but there can be no
doubt of this, that Peter is senior to
Martin; and, as Patrick has always
acted as a junior brother to Martin,
we venture to think that it is a reasonable
request, that Squire Bull shall
hereafter acknowledge Peter's nominees
as equal in dignity to Patrick's."</p>

<p>It is difficult to say whether Claretson
was really humbugged by this
jesuitical oration, or whether he was
so far misled in judgment as to consider
their views reasonable. Certain
it is that he gave them a most civil
answer; and reported the matter to
the Juggler, who was then in particularly
good humour, as his character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and perhaps his place, depended
on the suppression of the riot. So
he called together several of the
servants, showed them Claretson's
letter, and begged them to speak their
minds freely.</p>

<p>"My own view is," quoth he,
"that nothing can be more reasonable.
Patrick may perhaps fume
and get into a huff about it, but who
cares for Patrick? He may be very
glad that he is allowed to draw his
stipend, and what matters it to him
whether he walks first or last?"</p>

<p>"And I think," said Gray&mdash;not
the old Gaffer, who, as you know,
brought in Madam Reform, but his
son and successor&mdash;"I think we can't
do less for Peter, considering his very
handsome conduct in this business.
I am for going still further. Why
not make the rule universal in all
Squire Bull's properties and estates
beyond Bullockshatch? It may not
be altogether convenient to bring
in Peter here, just at the present
moment; but we can think about
that afterwards. Meanwhile let us
give him what he wants; and let
him walk first everywhere except in
Bullockshatch."</p>

<p>"I, for one, am perfectly agreeable,"
said Timber, who, being a man
of exceedingly limited ideas, always
made a point of coinciding with the
opinions of the rest.</p>

<p>"So be it!" quoth Protocol. "But
don't you think we might even go a
step further? I find it a main inconvenience
that I am not allowed to
write direct to Peter whenever I have
occasion to know the last quotations
of indulgences, holy water, or pardons.
Could we not arrange among
ourselves to send over some respectable
gentleman, who might look after
any business of the Squire's in those
parts, and occasionally pop in in a
friendly way, and take pot-luck with
Peter? I own that it would be a great
accommodation to me, and I don't
see how any one could object to it."</p>

<p>The Juggler, however, who had
recently been thinking a good deal on
that very subject, shook his head,
remarking that Squire Bull had long
ago expressed his determination that
none of his servants should hold
direct intercourse with Peter. "And,"
said he, "that is precisely one of the
points upon which he is most obstinate
and fractious. If we were openly
to broach this matter to him, it
might go far to lose us our places.
But I'll tell you what;&mdash;there may
be a way to get round the bush, and
establish a communication with Peter,
without incurring the scandal. There's
my near connection, Mat-o'-the-Mint,
who, between ourselves, is of no
earthly use here beyond keeping the
keys of a certain place which shall be
nameless. Suppose we send him out
nominally on a visit to Signor Macaroni,
or any other squires in the
south, and give him a general roving
commission? He'll like the job vastly,
I can tell you; for, of course, we shall
charge his whole expenses to the
Squire; and he can take that opportunity
of seeing Peter, and arranging
as to future proceedings."</p>

<p>No objection being made to this
very convenient arrangement, Mat-o'-the-Mint
received his credentials.
This individual was one of the most
lucky men alive, and seemed born
specially to refute the proverb, that
service is no inheritance. It was
difficult at any time to say what he
was fit for, for he rarely uttered words
of more value than&mdash;"Ay, ay! my
masters! this is a fine day, as the
ancient philosopher remarked." Or,
"In respect to that, my opinion is
whatever Providence may please."
Notwithstanding this oracular turn of
mind, he generally contrived to have
himself appointed to some snug place
in the household, where there was
plenty to get and little to do; and it
is fair to add, that he never forgot any
of his own relations, when he could
contrive to provide for them at the
Squire's expense.</p>

<p>Peter, who was always alert and
vigilant in doing mischief, had, at
this moment, more irons in the fire
than usual. In the first place, he
was getting up a private demonstration
in his own village, for the purpose,
if possible, of making himself
popular with his people, who used
most cordially to detest him. Secondly,
he wished to stir up the whole
tenantry of Signor Macaroni against
Don Ferdinando, who had for a long
time held a considerable farm in
mortgage. Thirdly, he wanted to
make all the world believe that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
was an altered character since the
days when he presided at hangings,
burnings, torturings, and other devilish
acts of cruelty. And, fourthly, he was
most especially anxious, in one way
or another, to get speech of Squire
Bull. You must know that there
was a quarrel of long standing between
the two; John, in his younger
days, having been insulted and domineered
over by Peter and his emissaries,
until his patience could bear it
no longer; so, one fine day, he armed
himself with a horsewhip, lashed the
whole gang of them out of Bullockshatch,
and swore the most solemn of
possible oaths that they should never
again set foot within his property if
he could prevent it; nor would he
even acknowledge that such a being
as Peter existed on the face of the
earth. Peter, on the other hand, was
resolved that he should get some of
his people located on John's estate, in
spite of all his opposition; and, by
dint of perseverance, he ultimately
carried his point. For example,
Squire Bull would observe from his
window an olive-faced fellow in black
clothes and purple stockings, with a
surtout down to his heels, no shirt-collar,
and a shovel hat, pacing down
the avenue, and pretending to be
reading from a small book with illuminated
characters. At this apparition
the Squire would start, and sing
out to the nearest of the servants&mdash;"Lookye
there now! what fellow is
that? A spy of Peter's, I dare be
sworn! Have I not told you, over
and over again, that not one of them
shall be quartered here?" Then the
servant whom he accosted would put
on his spectacles, take a long look at
the walking spider before him, and
reply quite calmly, "Bless your heart,
Squire! you are clean mistaken altogether.
I know that person perfectly
well. He is a highly respectable
foreigner, who has taken lodgings for
a few months in the village for the
benefit of country air. He is the
Bishop of Timbuctoo, I think&mdash;or,
now that I look again, I see it is the
Vicar-Apostolic of New Guinea&mdash;a
most agreeable, accomplished, gentlemanly
man, I assure you." And if
this did not satisfy the Squire&mdash;which
it rarely did, for he used to growl like
a mastiff whenever he caught sight of
one of those gentry&mdash;the servant
would put it to him whether it was
the part of a Christian and an esquire
to harbour ill-will against a gentleman
who was merely residing for
temporary purposes upon his estate,
and who occupied a great portion of
his time in visiting the sick and in
relieving the poor? On these occasions,
John had invariably the worst
of the argument; and the upshot was,
that one of these temporary residenters
was presently located in every village
of the estate, and showed no symptom
of moving. Very little regard
had they for the spiritual concerns of
their flocks in Timbuctoo or New
Guinea! But to make up for that
omission, they took immense pains
with the tenantry of Bullockshatch,
building chapels in which they burned
a mild kind of consecrated incense,
erecting schools wherein they taught
the children gratis, and wheedling
everybody in the most amiable and
conciliatory manner possible. They
even contrived to make mischief in
Martin's family, as I shall presently
have occasion to tell you. As for
Peter's friends on the farm across the
pond, they pretended to no disguise
at all, but broadly maintained their
intention to support him at all hazards,
and to do his bidding. There were
no Bishops of Timbuctoo, or Terra-del-fuego
there. So many of the
tenantry were of their opinion, that
they did not care one pinch of snuff
for your <i>pr&aelig;munires</i>, or other legal
bugbears.</p>

<p>Now, what Peter wanted was to
bring Bullockshatch to precisely the
same condition as the detached farm.
He had got himself, as one may say,
firmly established in the lesser spot;
and he was determined to move
heaven and earth, and mayhap another
place, to acquire an equal footing
in the bigger one. This he could
hardly hope to do, without coming to
some sort of terms with Squire Bull,
through his servants, and he had been
long privately expecting to find an
opportunity by means of Protocol,
who was a reckless creature, and
hardly ever condescended to give a
single thought to Martin. Protocol,
in fact, was a kind of secular Peter.
He was never so happy as when swimming
in troubled waters; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
main difference between them was,
that Protocol cared for nothing but
excitement, whereas Peter never for
a moment lost sight of the main
chance. You may conceive, therefore,
with what joy the latter received
the intimation that he might expect,
in a short while, to receive a private
and confidential visit from no less a
person than Mat-o'-the-Mint. Not
that Mat was any great acquisition in
himself; but being a near relative of
the Juggler, and also an upper servant
in Squire Bull's household, nothing
could be more consonant with
the secret wishes of Peter. So he
ordered three chapels to be illuminated,
and a special prayer to be
chanted for the conversion of Bullockshatch;
at the mention of which
name, it is recorded that some images
winked their eyes!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

HOW MAT-O'-THE-MINT UNDERTOOK AN EXPEDITION TO THE ESTATES OF SIGNOR MACARONI;
AND WHAT FOLLOWED THEREUPON.</h3>

<p>Mat-o'-the-Mint, then, having got
his roving commission signed in due
form, and his pocket-book well stuffed
with bank-notes, set out upon his
tour like an actual walking mystery.
It is my opinion, up to the present
hour, that the excellent gentleman
had no precise idea of what he was
expected to do; but that his general
notion was that he was bound to give
advice&mdash;at least such advice as he
could give&mdash;to any one who asked him
for it. No man can be expected to
accomplish impossibilities: he can
merely do his best; and that Mat-o'-the-Mint
was prepared to perform
quite conscientiously. It was not his
fault, if those who sent him did not
make him comprehend their design;
indeed Protocol, who was a sly fox,
and always left a door of escape open
for himself in case of emergency, was
not likely to be too specific in his instructions,
or to commit himself irretrievably
on paper.</p>

<p>No sooner was it noised abroad that
Mat-o'-the-Mint was on his travels,
than there was a considerable stir both
among the southern squirearchy and
their tenantry, who were then unfortunately
at loggerheads. Everybody
who had a dispute with anybody else
wanted to know what Squire Bull
thought of the matter, hoping probably
that he would not be disinclined
to lend him a helping hand, and mayhap
a few pounds; for the fellows in
those parts laboured under the delusion
that the Squire was made of
money. So they were all anxious to
get a confidential hearing from Mat-o'-the-Mint,
whom they imagined to
be a very great man indeed, and a
very wise one; arguing, naturally
enough, that the Squire would not
have entrusted such a mission except
to a person of consummate prudence
and discretion. Little they knew of
the Juggler or Protocol, or of the way
in which Squire Bull's business was
conducted! But to resume. One fine
day Mat-o'-the-Mint arrived on the
estate of a gentleman, Don Vesuvius,
who was an old friend of Bull's, and
was received at the boundary by the
ground-steward, who, in the very
civilest possible manner, presented his
master's compliments, and requested
that Master Matthew would drive
straight up to the Hall, where a handsome
suite of apartments was ready
for his accommodation. Privately,
and in his heart, Mat would have liked
nothing better; but he was not quite
sure whether Protocol would approve
of his doing so, especially as Don
Vesuvius was notoriously on bad
terms with some of his own people.
So he thought it best to decline for
the present.</p>

<p>"My compliments," quoth he, "to
your master, and say to him that I
am quite sensible that he has done
the proper thing in asking me to the
Hall. But you see that I am so
situated that I can't very well come.
My master, the squire, has heard a
good deal of what is going on in these
parts; and though, as a matter of
course, he has no wish to interfere
between the Don and his tenantry,
yet the fact is that, under present
circumstances, I had better put up
at the inn. Say to your master that
I shall be glad to see him there, any
time he may be passing; at all events,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
I shall certainly make a point of
writing him my opinion on the general
question, in the course of a day or
so."</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that there
were a number of lazy-looking fellows,
with knives in their belts, loitering
around the drosky while Mat-o'-the-Mint
delivered this answer to the
ground steward; and these were precisely
the worst of the whole crew
with whom Don Vesuvius was at
feud. Who so rejoiced as they to
find that Squire Bull's confidential
servant was likely to be on their side!
They threw up their hats, and brayed,
and danced, and cut fandangos, to all
which Mat-o'-the-Mint replied by
taking off his hat and bowing like a
Chinese mandarin. At last, in the
exuberance of their joy, the crowd
took the horses out of the vehicle, and
fairly dragged him to the village inn,
leaving the unhappy ground steward
as disconsolate as Ariadne on Naxos.</p>

<p>No sooner were they arrived at the
inn, than Mat asked a number of the
men to step up to his sitting-room;
and having questioned them regarding
their grievances, which you may
be sure they took care to magnify to
the utmost, he called for pen, ink, and
paper, and sate himself down to write
a long epistle to Don Vesuvius. I
can't give you the particulars of this
document, further than that it contained
an intimation that in his,
Mat-o'-the-Mint's opinion, the gentleman
had been very much misled
in the management of his own affairs.
That for the sake of restoring peace
and tranquillity, it appeared to the
aforesaid Matthew that Don Vesuvius
would do well to surrender one half
of his estate to the tenantry, without
receiving any consideration for it;
and that if this arrangement, which
he merely ventured to suggest, should
meet with approbation, there could
be no difficulty whatever in reducing
the rents on the remaining half. As
also that the undersigned was with
the highest consideration, &amp;c. &amp;c.
Having finished this doughty epistle,
which he despatched by the boots of
the inn, Mat ordered his equipage,
and drove away to another estate, as
proud as Punch, amidst the shouts of
the whole idlers of the village.</p>

<p>You may fancy the astonishment of
the honest gentleman when he read
Mat's letter. It was some time before
he could believe the evidence of
his spectacles. "Good heavens!"
he said, "is it possible that Squire
Bull can treat an old friend and
fellow-sportsman thus? Haven't I
dozens upon dozens of letters under
his own hand, guaranteeing me possession
of my whole estate, and am I
now to be fobbed off in this way, and
insulted to boot by an old trencherman
of whom nobody ever heard?
But I won't believe it! It must be
some trick of that rascal, Protocol,
who is perpetually writing letters
without authority in the name of his
master&mdash;at all events, I won't submit
to be dictated to, in the disposal of
my own, by the best Squire living!"</p>

<p>By this time, however, the riotous
portion of the tenantry were fully
possessed with the notion that Squire
Bull was ready to back them up to
any extent; so they began a regular
insurrection, fired at the gamekeepers,
beat the watchmen, and barricaded
one of the villages, after they had
thoroughly plundered it. But they
reckoned without their host; for the
tenantry on the home farm were to a
man true to their master, and having
armed themselves, they crossed the
canal, (in which, by the way, some of
John's barges were lying, it was
thought with the connivance of Protocol,)
and gave the rascally rabble
such a drubbing, that nothing more
was heard afterwards about the partition
of the property. The rioters,
however, believe to this hour that
they were deceived by Squire Bull,
who, they aver, had promised to support
them, and they accordingly hate
him like ratsbane; neither, as you
may well conceive, is Don Vesuvius,
whose property was proposed to be
divided, over and above grateful for
this impudent interference with his
private affairs.</p>

<p>This, however, was a mere segment
of the mischief which was effected by
Mat-o'-the-Mint. Wherever he went
he tendered advice; and whenever
that advice was given, rioting ensued.
In short, he proved such a nuisance,
that well-affected people would much
rather have submitted to a visit from
the cholera. At last he arrived at
Peter's patrimony, a place which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
by no means tranquil at the time.
Notwithstanding Peter's boasting,
and his perpetual attempt to get his
emissaries quartered on every estate
in the country, he was the reverse of
popular at home. He had a very
handsome house, which he kept full of
friars, monks, Jesuits, Dominicans,
Carthusians, and Grand Inquisitors,
fellows who did little else than eat,
drink, sleep, and conspire at the
expense of the working population.
This had become so intolerable, that
Peter, though the most tyrannical
despot upon earth, found it necessary
to come down a peg or two, and announced
his intention of revising the
laws of his household, which, to say
the truth, needed mending sorely.
But he did not stop there. He began
to intrigue for a restoration of the
whole estates which were formerly in
the family of Signor Macaroni, but
which latterly had passed into the
hands of other proprietors&mdash;for example,
Don Ferdinando; and, at the
time I speak of, his village was filled
with every description of cut-throat,
robber, and murderer that could be
gathered from the country round, all
of them shouting "Long life to Peter!"
and "Hurrah for the independence
of Macaroni!" They were in the
very midst of this jubilation, which
sounded more like an echo of Pandemonium
than anything else, when
Mat-o'-the-Mint drove into the town;
and the moment they heard of his
arrival, the very worst of them&mdash;Massaniello,
Massaroni, Corpo di
Caio Mario, and Vampyrio degli
Assassinacione&mdash;congregated under
the windows, and whooped and
howled, till Mat, in an access of terror,
came out upon the balcony,
pressed a flag, with a death's-head
and cross-bones upon it, to his bosom,
and proposed three cheers for the
independence of Macaroni! You
may conceive what a taking the poor
fellow must have been in before he
ventured to do anything of the sort.</p>

<p>Mat, being thus committed to Macaroni,
was a mere baby in the hands
of Peter. They had an interview to
discuss the affairs of the neighbouring
Squirearchy, and any other little
matters which might occur to either;
which Mat felt as an honour, whilst
Peter was feeling his pulse. Peter,
like an aged villain as he was, affected
to be extremely straightforward
and open in his remarks, and quite
confidential in his communications;
so that, in the course of half an hour,
poor Mat was entirely at his mercy.
After they had chatted for a short
time, and cracked a bottle or so of
Lachrym&aelig; together, Peter claps me
down a map of the whole country,
whereon Squire Bull's farm was
marked out with some twelve or
thirteen crosses, before Mat, and
asked him whether he thought it was
all correct?</p>

<p>"Undubitably," quoth Mat-o'-the-Mint,
who regarded the crosses as
simply indicative of the villages.</p>

<p>"Then there can be no objections
to the publication of a map of this
kind upon hierarchical principles?"
continued Peter, ogling his victim at
the same time, as a fox makes love
to a gander.</p>

<p>"Hier&mdash;I beg your pardon"&mdash;said
Mat-o'-the-Mint, who was not overburdened
with lore at any time, and
just then was rather confuscated.
"Hieroglyphical principles, did you
say?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;hierarchical principles," insinuated
Peter, with a smile intended
to convey the utmost amount of indulgence.
"Hiero, you know, was
one of our earliest geographers."</p>

<p>"To be sure he was"&mdash;replied
Mat-o'-the-Mint&mdash;"and an intimate
friend of Leander's&mdash;I've read of him
in the <i>Imaginary Conversations</i>&mdash;There
can be no objections, of course.
The map's a capital map!"</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to hear you say so,"
said Peter, sounding a little silver
whistle which dangled from his button-hole,
"it is always matter of
satisfaction to me to meet with a
plain, intellectual, honourable, enlightened
gentleman, who knows
what's what, and is above all manner
of prejudice.&mdash;You may take away
that map, Hippopotamus"&mdash;he continued,
as an individual in purple stockings
entered the room. "Mr Matthew
is perfectly satisfied as to its correctness,
and you may mention that when
you write to your friends at home."</p>

<p>Hippopotamus swept up the plan
and retired; but long after he closed
the door, you might have heard a
sniggering in the lobby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"And now, my very dear friend,"
quoth Peter, "let's have a fresh bottle
of Lachrym&aelig;, and a little conversation
about those affairs of Patrick's."</p>

<p>It matters very little what passed
upon that score, for the job was already
settled; but Peter probably
thought it safest to make this appear
the principal topic of their conversation.
They sate up a long time together;
and Mat-o'-the-Mint found it
no easy matter to get home to his
hotel, or to ring up the porter when
he arrived there.</p>

<p>So far Peter thought that he was
carrying everything his own way;
but he was labouring all the while
under a confounded mistake. Massaniello,
Massaroni, and the rest, were
glad enough to get into the village,
and to throw up their caps for Peter
and Macaroni, so long as they received
free quarters, but not a moment
longer. They had now time given them
to peer into the churches and shops,
and to reckon what might be turned
to account; and they had made up
their minds that if they could only
get rid of Peter, there was plunder
enough to be had out of his patrimony
to maintain themselves in
comfort for the remaining portion
of their lives. Once having ascertained
this, they lost no time in carrying
their plans into execution. They
broke out into actual revolt, stabbed
one of Peter's servants on the stairs,
shut up the old firebrand himself in his
drawing-room, and discharged pistols
into the windows, until they succeeded
in frightening him out of his seven
senses, and drove him out of the village
in the disguise of an ordinary
cabman. Then they began, as a matter
of course, to help themselves to
every man's property, and to share
upon principles of equality. You have
no idea what a row all this made.
Even Ferdinando was furious, for
though he had no great cause to
regard Peter, he liked still less the
rascally ruffians who had turned him
out of house and home, and he proposed
straightway to march a <i>posse
comitatus</i> against them. But young
Nap, now styled Administrator of the
Baboonery, was before him. He had
more idle fellows on hand than he
knew what to do with, so he sent a
whole gang of them off to clear Peter's
patrimony of the rioters, and mayhap,
if convenient, to bring back the old
Jesuit in person. Terrible were the
execrations of Massaniello and his
friends when they were summoned to
surrender by young Nap's people!
They said&mdash;what was true enough&mdash;that
if the others were entitled to eject
Philip Baboon, they were entitled to
turn Peter about his business; and
they protested that the people of each
estate should be allowed to manage
their own matters without interference.
But interference was the order of the
day. Everybody was interfering; so
Nap's men gave them to understand
that they did not intend to be exceptions
to the general rule. In short,
Massaniello and his friends must
evacuate or&mdash;take the consequences.
And, accordingly, evacuate they did,
though not without a good deal of
burning of gunpowder, levying of
subsidies, abduction of church-plate,
&amp;c.; and, in due course of time, old
Peter was brought back, amidst a
discharge of Roman candles, squibs,
crackers, and Catherine wheels; and
with him returned the whole host of
Jesuits, monks, and inquisitors, singing
<i>Quare fremuerunt gentes?</i> and ten
times more ready for any kind of mischief
than before.</p>

<p>And where all this while, you may
ask, was Mat-o'-the-Mint? Snug
at home. Some of the upper servants
in the household of Squire Bull had
got an inkling of the business he was
after, and put questions, which were
neither easy to answer nor agreeable
to evade. The Squire himself began
to grumble. Protocol could not help
perceiving that he had got into a scrape
by sending out such an envoy; and
even the Juggler did not care to have
the matter publicly mentioned, but
was willing that it should fall into
oblivion. It is, however, easier to
open a negotiation with Peter, than to
get out of one. The difficulty is not
to catch the lobster, but to force him
to leave go after he has fastened on
you with his claws; and you shall
presently hear what took place in
Bullockshatch, not long after the time
when Peter was reinstated in his
patrimony.</p>

<p>The brief but brilliant struggle
which was terminated, on the 13th
August 1849, by the surrender of
Vilagos, is unquestionably one of
the most remarkable episodes in
contemporary history; and numerous
as are the writers, both in Germany
and England, who have applied
themselves to exhibit and comment
on its circumstances, it yet is not wonderful
that the interest of the subject
is far from exhausted. A Schlesinger,
a Pulsky, and a Klapka, graphic and
striking as are their delineations of
the singular contest in which they all
more or less participated, have still
left much for their successors to tell.
The volume before us&mdash;a German
collective translation of tales and
sketches by several Hungarian authors&mdash;is
of a different class from the
works of the above-named writers.
It does not aspire to the dignity of
historical memoirs, nor is the form it
affects&mdash;namely, the romantic&mdash;one
that we usually much admire when
applied to such recent and important
events as those of which Hungary has
been the theatre; events, too, of
themselves so striking and fascinating
as to render fictitious colouring superfluous.
Nevertheless, these sketches
must be admitted to have considerable
merit. They are vivid and characteristic
illustrations of a remarkable
country, a heroic people, and an extraordinary
period; and the amount
of fiction interwoven is, in most instances,
little more than is necessary
to string together historical facts.
Some few of them have little to do
with the late war, but all throw more
or less light upon the state and character
of Hungary and its inhabitants.
Their success in that country, the
German preface assures us, and we
can readily believe, has been very
great. Some of them read like prose
translations of poems; and with the
exception of three or four, which are
terse and matter-of-fact enough, their
style has often a wild and metaphorical
vagueness, recalling the semi-oriental
character of the country
whence they proceed. Those which
take for their foundation the cruelties
perpetrated by the Serbs upon the
Magyars, and the fearful retaliation
thereby provoked, are too horrible&mdash;not
for truth, but to be pleasant reading;
others border on the humorous,
whilst some combine the tragic with
the gay. Of this last class is the opening
sketch by Saj&oacute;, entitled <i>A Ball</i>.
It is a letter from a young lady to a
friend, describing her and her mother's
terror at the anticipated arrival of a
Hungarian division, after English
Guyon's glorious victory at Branisko;
and relating how the old woman hid
herself in cupboards and clock-cases,
and urged her daughter to stain her
face black, in order to diminish her
personal attractions&mdash;advice which the
daughter, not exactly comprehending
its motive, most indignantly rejects.
Presently she is astonished by the
arrival of a couple of handsome hussar
officers, instead of the leather-clad
Calmuck-visaged barbarians, seven
feet high, and with beards to their
waists, which her mamma has predicted;
and still more is she surprised
when, instead of breaking open doors
and ill-treating women, the newcomers
organise a ball for that very
night&mdash;a ball which she attends, and
where she is greatly smitten with an
elegant captain of Honveds. He has
just led her out to dance, when the
ball-room windows rattle to the sound
of cannon, and a splashed hussar announces
an attack upon the outposts.
The officers buckle on their sabres
and hurry to the fight, begging the
ladies to await their return. In little
more than an hour they reappear in
the ball-room. They have repulsed
the enemy, and return flushed and
laughing to the dance. But the
handsome Honved is not amongst
them. The interrupted quadrille is
reformed, but Laura still awaits her
partner. A tall dry-mannered major,
of valiant reputation, approaches her.
"Fair lady," he says, "your partner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>begs a thousand pardons for his absence.
With the best will in the
world, he cannot have the pleasure of
dancing with you, for his leg has been
shot away and amputated above the
knee." This is the whole of the
story&mdash;little enough, and owing everything
to the manner of telling. The
second tale, <i>Claudia</i>, by Szilagyi, is
striking and powerful rather than
agreeable. We pass on to <i>The Chapel
at Tarczal</i>. All who have read Max
Schlesinger's admirable narrative of
the <i>War in Hungary</i>, will assuredly
remember his account of the Hungarian
hussar, "the embodiment of
Magyarism, born and reared upon the
heath," loving his country before all
things, and, next to his country, his
horse. "There are no soldiers in the
Austrian army," says Schlesinger,
"who can compare with him in chivalrous
daring, dexterity, precision
in man&oelig;uvres, strict subordination,
cleanliness, and fidelity."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Mr Saj&oacute;
loves to exalt the virtues, and exemplify
the eccentricities, of this fine
race of cavalry soldiers. In several
of his tales he introduces the heroic
hussar, cheerfully suffering and sacrificing
himself for Hungary's good and
the honour of his corps. The opening
scene of <i>The Chapel at Tarczal</i> is an
amusing sketch of one of these
veterans, thoroughly persuaded of the
immeasurable superiority of the
Magyar over all other men, and of
the hussar over every other soldier.</p>

<p>"The Austrians had won the battle;
the Hungarians had lost it.
The Austrian general was taking his
ease in his quarters, with his staff
around him; an officer entered, and
reported the capture of a hussar.</p>

<p>"Bring him in," said the General,
who was in excellent humour. He
himself wore the uniform of the hussar
regiment he had formerly commanded,
and had unbuckled his sabre and
made himself comfortable; whilst his
officers stood around buttoned to the
chin, and strictly according to regulation.</p>

<p>The hussar entered&mdash;a bare-headed
veteran with gray mustaches. His
face was still black with the smoke of
Schwechat's battle; his stiffly-waxed
mustaches stuck out fiercely right
and left. He glanced gloomily around
him, evidently ill-pleased with his
company, until his eye fell upon the
General. Then a gleam came over
his features, like the sun breaking
through a cloud, and he was near
shouting for joy. The general laughed,
and clapped his hands together. He
recognised old Miska, his former
orderly, who had served him for five
years in Szobossl&oacute;.</p>

<p>"Do you know me again, old man?"
said he good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"At your service, Colonel," replied
the hussar, raising his hand to his
brow, as though his schako were still
on his head.</p>

<p>"General, not Colonel," interposed
one of the officers.</p>

<p>Silently and contemptuously the
hussar measured the speaker with his
eyes, wondering that an infantry-man,
captain though he might be, dared
intrude upon the conversation of
hussars.</p>

<p>"So you have let yourself be taken
prisoner, Miska?" said the General,
willing to tease his old servant.</p>

<p>"What could I do, Colonel? There
were so many against me. I got into
a crowd of them."</p>

<p>"You knocked over a few, I dare
say."</p>

<p>"I did not count them, but <i>something</i>
remained upon the ground."</p>

<p>"Right, Miska. Let them give
you a dram, and then go to my
grooms; if anybody meddles with
you, give him as good as he brings."</p>

<p>The hussar thanked his former
colonel, but seemed in small haste to
leave the room. The General noticed
him no farther, but turned again to
his officers and resumed the discussion
of his plan of campaign. Suddenly
he felt a pull at his pelisse, and
turning, beheld Miska, who had stolen
quietly behind him. With an unintelligible
gesture, and a countenance of
extraordinary mystery, the hussar
pointed to something.</p>

<p>"Colonel! Colonel!" he whispered,
redoubling the eagerness of his
gesticulations. The General had no
notion of his meaning. "Colonel, reach
me yonder sabre from the corner."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>"What the devil do you want
with it?"</p>

<p>"Only give it here! In two minutes
there shall not be a German in the
room."</p>

<p>Miska thought his colonel was a
prisoner.</p>

<p>The General burst into a hearty
laugh, and told his officers of the
hussar's kind intentions towards them.
The laughter became general. The
officers crowded round the old soldier,
clapped him on the shoulder, and
made much of him.</p>

<p>"Well, Miska, you will take service
with us, eh?" said the General,
curious to hear his answer.</p>

<p>"There are no hussar regiments
here!" replied the old soldier, twisting
his mustaches.</p>

<p>"What matter? You shall be a
cuirassier. We'll make a serjeant of
you."</p>

<p>"Many thanks. Can't stand it.
Should have been serjeant long ago,
if I could write."</p>

<p>"What do you think of doing then?
Eat your ration in idleness?"</p>

<p>"Not so&mdash;by your honour's favour&mdash;but
make a run for it."</p>

<p>The honest answer pleased the
General. The hussar saw that it did.</p>

<p>"A whole regiment of those gaiter-legged
fellows could not keep me," he
added.</p>

<p>One of the officers asked him
angrily why he wished to go back.
Those were mistaken, if any, who
expected a rude answer from the
hussar.</p>

<p>"Yonder is my regiment," he replied,
again twirling his mustache.
"A true soldier bides by his colours."</p>

<p>To this nothing could be objected.</p>

<p>"Well, Miska, that you may not
desert from us, I let you go free."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Colonel." Once more the
hand was raised to the schako's place.</p>

<p>"You can go."</p>

<p>The hussar lingered, rubbed his
nose, and frowned.</p>

<p>"Colonel&mdash;you surely do not intend
me to pass through the whole
camp in hussar uniform, and on foot.
I should die of shame. Let them give
me back my horse."</p>

<p>"Your horse? That is the Emperor's
property, my son."</p>

<p>"I crave your pardon, Colonel! I
reared the horse myself from a colt.
I have ridden it for ten years, and it
comes at my whistle. By every right
it belongs to me. I would rather a
bullet hit me than lose the good
brute."</p>

<p>"Well, take it."</p>

<p>Even now the hussar did not seem
satisfied.</p>

<p>"Colonel! can I go back to my
regiment in this scandalous manner?&mdash;without
my sabre? I shall have to
run the gauntlet; they will think I
have sold it for drink."</p>

<p>"It shall be restored to you." The
General made sign to his orderly;
the hussar saluted, and turned to depart.
But at the door he once more
paused, and gazed pathetically at his
former chief.</p>

<p>"Colonel!" he said, in the most
insinuating tone he could command.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Colonel&mdash;come over to us!"</p>

<p>And with a bound he was out of the
room, feeling well enough that he had
said something extraordinarily stupid,
but which he could not help saying
though it had cost him his head.</p>

<p>When horse and sabre were restored
to him, one of the General's
grooms, a mischievous fellow, trod on
the hussar's spur, breaking the rowel,
and then sprang aside laughing.</p>

<p>The old hussar shook his clenched
fist menacingly.</p>

<p>"Wait a little, Italian!" he cried,
"I will find you yet." Then saluting
the General's window with his sabre,
he galloped away.</p>

<p>It was thought that a tear glistened
in the General's eye, as he turned to
his staff, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Such soldiers should <i>we</i> have!"</p>

<p>Such were the soldiers with whom
G&ouml;rgey drove before him the best
generals of Austria; with whom he
triumphed in that brilliant conflict,
of fourteen days' duration, which terminated
in the capture of Pesth, the
relief of Komorn, and the complete
retreat of the Imperialists.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> These
were the men who rode up to the very
mouths of the Austrian cannon at
Isazeg,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and who followed, in twenty
conflicts, the well-known war-cry of
the gigantic Serb, D&aacute;mj&aacute;nics. Of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>last-named general (of whom Schlesinger
has given many interesting
details,) we find an interesting and
authentic anecdote in Saj&oacute;'s vigorous
military sketch, entitled <i>The Two
Brides</i>.</p>

<p>D&aacute;mj&aacute;nics and his troops encamped
in the night at two leagues from Szolnok.
In order of battle, and without
watch-fires, they there awaited the
signal to advance. The signal was the
sound of cannon, fired beyond the
Theiss.</p>

<p>The Hungarian General had already
fought many battles, won many victories,
taken many standards. When
he began a battle, he stationed himself
in front of his army, looked where
the foe was strongest, shouted "Mir
nach!"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and rushed forward, overthrowing
and crushing all before him.
It was his way.</p>

<p>There were persons who did not
like this way, and who wearied him
with assurances that, to be a renowned
general, it is not enough to win
battles; one must also leave permanent
evidence of merit, to be handed
down to future generations; one must
make speeches, issue proclamations,
and so forth.</p>

<p>So it came to pass, when he marched
away from the Banat, that he addressed
to the hostile party in the
province a proclamation which has
become celebrated. It was word for
word as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye dogs!</p>

<p>"I depart. But I shall come back
again.</p>

<p>"If in the interval you dare to stir,
I will extirpate you from the face of
the earth; and then, that the seed
of the Serbs may be extinct, I, the
last of them, will shoot myself."</p>

<p>The success of this first attempt so
encouraged the General, that, after
much persuasion, he gave a solemn
promise to make a speech to his army
when next they went into action.</p>

<p>On the eve of the battle, D&aacute;mj&aacute;nics
felt his spirits extraordinarily low.</p>

<p>"Strange," thought he to himself,
"never yet have I trembled at the
approach of a fight, but now I feel as
if I had no stomach for it." And he
sought within himself the cause of this
unaccustomed mood, but all in vain.</p>

<p>Presently, however, one of his staff-officers
came to remind him that,
before the next day's battle, they
expected to hear the speech he
had promised them.</p>

<p>"Devil take it!" cried the General.
"<i>That</i> was what made me shake in my
boots. But never fear, it shall be done&mdash;I
will venture it&mdash;the speech you
shall have."</p>

<p>He had drawn out his plan of
battle in a quarter of an hour. But
morning dawned whilst he was still
hammering at his speech.</p>

<p>The troops stood in order of battle.
D&aacute;mj&aacute;nics rode along the front of the
line. Everybody knew he was to
make a speech, and what a cruel task
it was to him.</p>

<p>Before the colours of the ninth battalion
he halted, raised his hat and
spoke:</p>

<p>"Comrades!"</p>

<p>At that instant the artillery beyond
the Theiss boomed out its first discharge.
The General's face glowed,
he forgot phrases and oration, tore
his sabre from the scabbard, pressed
his schako down upon his brow, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yonder is the foe: follow me!"
he shouted in a voice of thunder. A
tremendous hurrah was his army's
reply, as they followed their leader,
with the speed and impetuosity of a
torrent, to the familiar encounter of
the Austrian cannon.</p>

<p>"Why is it," said D&aacute;mj&aacute;nics, as
he limped up to the gallows, after
seeing seven of his brave comrades
executed before his eyes, on the morning
of the fatal sixth of October 1849&mdash;"why
is it that I, who have ever
been foremost in the fight, must here
be the last?" That was no empty
boast in the dying man's mouth. "To
D&aacute;mj&aacute;nics," says Schlesinger, "after
G&ouml;rgey, belongs the glory of all the
battles from Hatvan to Komorn.
From the commencement of the movement,
he was the boldest champion of
the national cause." And whatever
his staff and his Austrian executioners
may have argued from his oratorical
incapacity and his ignominious death,
neither, assuredly, will prevent his
name's preservation on posterity's
list of patriot-heroes, even though he
should never obtain the monument
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>which it has been predicted that Hungary
will one day erect to him, upon
the spot where he mounted the scaffold.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the longest and
most remarkable sketch in the volume,
we will extract the beginning and end
of a humorous paper, written in true
soldier's style, entitled <i>From the Memoirs
of a Quartermaster</i>.</p>

<p>"I never saw such a man as my
lieutenant. It is not because he was
<i>my</i> lieutenant that I say so, but a merrier
fellow was not to be found in the
army. Were I a poet or a scholar, I
would make a fine romance out of his
adventures; but as I unfortunately
lack the learning, I must be content to
set down a few odd incidents of our
joyous camp-life, just as they occur to
my memory. It gives me pleasure to
recall these anecdotes of my late master,
who was lieutenant in the volunteers.
Those who knew him will not
have forgotten how gay a wooer he
was with women, and how brave a
soldier in war.</p>

<p>"They transferred us to a battalion
that lay in Siebenburgen, and which
was not yet completely equipped. Our
principal wants were muskets and
cartouch-boxes. Nobody had a greatcoat;
and, in another respect, the
battalion was quite uniform, for every
one went barefoot. My lieutenant
often complained to the captain, who
had been a Bohemian forester, and
afterwards a coffee-roaster in Pesth,
but who, when his daughter's husband
was promoted to be major of our battalion,
was by him appointed captain&mdash;to
him, I say, the lieutenant repeatedly
complained that the poor soldiers
were frozen, and should at least be
supplied with greatcoats. But all in
vain; the superior officers gambled
the money sent them by Government
for the equipment of the troops; and
all my lieutenant could obtain from
the ex-coffee-roaster was a <i>bon-mot</i>
which Napoleon, he said, had addressed
to his soldiers when they
complained in Egypt of bad clothing:
'Avec du pain et du fer on peut aller
&agrave; Chine.'</p>

<p>"The lieutenant made me write
these words on one hundred and fifty
small slips of paper, pinned these upon
his men's shoulders, and said&mdash;'There,
my lads, are your greatcoats.' Boots
were all that was now wanting. One
fine morning we received a hundred
and fifty bran-new&mdash;blacking-boxes!</p>

<p>"'<i>Engem ucse</i>,' said the lieutenant:
''tis good; instead of boots they send
us blacking.' And next day, when
the little gray general passed a review,
our company marched past with their
bare feet blacked and polished, and
with spurs drawn in chalk upon their
heels. The general laughed at first,
and then reprimanded the major. The
major laughed too, and scolded the
captain. Finally, the captain abused
my lieutenant, who abused him in
return; but, as the one understood no
Hungarian, and the other no German,
the dispute led to nothing.</p>

<p>"At last we got ourselves shod, by
gloriously ransacking a Wallachian
village, and thrusting our feet into the
red boots the women had left behind
them. Thenceforward our company
was known everywhere as 'the regiment
of Red Boots.'</p>

<p>"In our first engagement we had
not much to do. The enemy fired at
us from a distance, whilst we stood
still and looked at them. Some of the
recruits bobbed their heads aside when
they saw the shot coming through the
air. 'Don't shake your head, my
man,' the lieutenant would say; 'you
might chance to knock it against a
cannon-ball.' In the second action
we took a gun from the enemy. It
came up very near us and unlimbered;
but, before it had time to fire a shot,
my lieutenant made the soldiers believe
it was one of our own guns; that
the enemy were about to capture it;
and could we suffer this? We could
not suffer it, and rushed on: a few
shots met us; but before we well
knew what we did, the gun was in our
power. The whole was over in less
time than I take to tell it.</p>

<p>"From that day forward nobody
made fun of the Red Boots, and soon
we were supplied with muskets.
Many of these were hardly fit to fire
with; but bayonet and butt were
always there, wherewith to thrust and
strike.</p>

<p>"It was in the dog-days. For
three months we had received no pay.
At last, to silence my lieutenant's
terrible expostulations, they sent us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
money&mdash;fifteen notes of a hundred
florins each.</p>

<p>"The salaries of Government officials
were paid in fifteen-kreuzer
pieces; the money we soldiers wanted,
for our daily bread, was sent in hundred-florin
notes. Of course, nothing
could be easier, in the Wallach hamlets
in which we were cantoned, than
to get small change for fifteen hundred-florin
notes.</p>

<p>"Whilst my lieutenant was grumbling
over this, and puzzling his head
how to divide these few large notes
into many small ones, a courier arrived
and brought him a letter.</p>

<p>"The lieutenant read the letter, and
laughed out loud. Then he ordered a
parade. He was the only officer present.
Two captains and a major
were constantly rambling about, and
seldom saw their battalion, but left
everything to my lieutenant. So he
ordered the drums to beat for muster;
and when the men were assembled, he
informed them that their pay had
come just in the nick of time. Then
he produced the fifteen hundred
florins<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and a pair of scissors,
made the soldiers file past, and
cut off a slip of the notes for each
one of them. It was the only way
to divide them.</p>

<p>"This done, he came singing and
whistling into his quarters, laughed
and cut jokes, played a thousand
pranks, and at last called to me, and
asked if I had a dry cloth at hand, to
wipe up something.</p>

<p>"I answered that I had.</p>

<p>"'Go and fetch it, then.' And he
continued to laugh and jest, and
seemed in most wonderful good humour.
'Make haste,' he shouted after
me, as I hurried to fetch the cloth.
I felt quite sure he was going to play
me some famous trick, he looked so
sly and comical when he gave me the
order.</p>

<p>"Whilst I sought for a towel, I
heard the report of a firearm in the
next room. Towel in hand, I threw
open the door. The room was full of
smoke.</p>

<p>"'What am I to wipe up?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'This blood!' said the lieutenant,
who lay upon the ground. The warm
heart's-blood flowed from a wound in
his breast; in his hand he held a
pistol and the letter he had that morning
received.</p>

<p>"The letter announced the catastrophe
of Vilagos. In two minutes
he was dead.</p>

<p>"Thus did my lieutenant make a
fool of me, at last.</p>

<p>"Such a merry fellow was my
lieutenant."</p>

<p>The various memoirs of the Hungarian
war record more than one instance
of self-destruction and insanity,
amongst the enthusiastic defenders of
the Magyar cause, consequent upon
G&ouml;rgey's shameful surrender, and
the final downfall of their cherished
hopes. As far as the suicide goes,
therefore, there is nothing improbable
in the conduct of the eccentric lieutenant.
Passing over several shorter
papers, for the most part clever and
spirited, we come to the striking
tale, or rather series of scenes, entitled
<i>George of St Thomas</i>, which, besides
being the most carefully finished of
these sketches, includes several of the
most terrible and romantic historical
incidents of that war. Its construction
is favourable to extract,
and we propose to translate such portions
of it as our limits will allow, and
therewith close our notice of the
<i>Schlachtfelderbl&uuml;then aus Ungarn</i>. The

<h3>THE FIEND'S FESTIVAL.</h3>

<p>It was dark night in the town of
St Thomas. Not a star was visible.
Well was it that the heavens saw not
what then occurred upon earth.</p>

<p>Men who had grown gray together
in love and friendship, dwelling in the
same street, under the very same roof,
who were bound to each other by ties
of blood and kindred, of gratitude and
duty, who were wont to share each
other's joys and griefs, began, upon a
sudden, as if frantic with infernal inspirations,
to plot each other's extermination,
and to fill their souls with
bloody hatred against those who had
never wronged them.</p>

<p>It was St Eustace' day. The Raitzen<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>assembled in their church, to
worship God, as they said. But no
words of God were there, nor solemn
organ-notes; wild voices announced
approaching horrors, and the sainted
roof resounded with strains ominous
of strife.</p>

<p>The town's-people were tranquil.
Those amongst them who noticed that
their neighbours' windows were lighted
up, and who saw gloomy faces hurrying
to the church, said to themselves,
"To-day the Raitzen hold
high festival;" and thought no more
of it, but went their ways to bed.
Towards midnight the alarm-bell
sounded, the doors of the temple opened,
and the nocturnal revel began.</p>

<p>With wild howl the excited mob
burst into the houses of their sleeping
neighbours. It was as though they
had some ancient and inveterate
grudge to avenge, so fierce and bitter
was the fury with which they murdered
all whose windows showed no
lights&mdash;the token the Raitzen had
adopted, lest by error they should
assail each other's dwellings.</p>

<p>In two hours the Magyar population
of the town was exterminated, with
the exception of a scanty few who
escaped in carts and carriages. These,
however, were pursued; and when the
uproar in the town, the sounds of strife
and lamentation, and the clang of
bells, were hushed, cries of agony and
despair were still heard issuing at intervals
from the adjacent country, as
vehicles, stuck fast in the treacherous
swamps, were overtaken, and the luckless
fugitives ruthlessly butchered. At
last these heart-rending sounds also
ceased. Voices of complaint were no
longer audible, but in their stead, in
more than one quarter of the illuminated
town, were heard music, and
dancing, and merriment.</p>

<p>It was long past midnight when a
cart drove through the streets of St
Thomas. In it sat a man wrapped in
his cloak, marvelling greatly at the
lights in the houses, and the sounds
of festivity and joy. At his own house-door
he stopped his horse. To his
great surprise, his dwelling also was
lighted up, and within were sounds
of music, a hum of voices, and noise
of dancing feet. Astounded and
anxious, he stepped silently to a window,
and through it he beheld a crowd
of well-known faces. The company,
flushed with wine and excitement,
sang and shouted, and drank out of his
glasses, and danced madly round the
room. They were all old acquaintances,
and inhabitants of the town.</p>

<p>Ignorant of the events of the night,
the man thought he was dreaming.</p>

<p>Presently his attention was attracted
by the licentious garb and demeanour
of a woman, who circulated
amongst the guests with loud laugh
and libertine gestures, sharing in and
stimulating the orgies. At first, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>could not discern who this woman
was. Then he recognised her. It
was his own wife.</p>

<p>"Hold!" he shouted, and strode
into the room where these saturnalia
were in progress. He knew not what
to do or say; it were hard to find a
word which should express the rage
that possessed him.</p>

<p>"Hold!" he thundered out, every
fibre quivering with fury, "what do
ye here?"</p>

<p>The guests stood aghast at that
apparition of wrath. The boldest
started at sight of the man, as he
stood amongst them, terrible and
deadly pale. For a while none dared
approach him. He went up to his
wife, a dark-haired, black-eyed, red-cheeked
wanton, who stood as if
turned to stone. He fixed his eyes
upon hers with a deadly gaze.</p>

<p>"On your knees!"</p>

<p>The woman stirred not.</p>

<p>"On your knees, wretch!" vociferated
the husband, and struck her in
the face, so that she fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Hold, dog!" was shouted on all
sides. The Raitzen rushed forward,
and the man was seized by twenty
hands. He struggled against them,
grasped the throat of one, and relaxed
not his clutch, even when thrown
down and trampled under foot, until
he had choked his adversary to death.
They bound his hands and thrust him
into a corner. The Raitzen formed a
circle about him.</p>

<p>"What would ye of me?" he asked,
the blood flowing from his mouth.</p>

<p>"What would we? Look around
you. See you not that all here are
Raitzen?" replied a tall dark-browed
Serb, scowling scornfully and cruelly
at the sufferer.</p>

<p>"And I a Magyar. What then?"</p>

<p>"Ask thy neighbours. Hast thou
not heard that to-day is our festival?
The festival of the extermination of
the Magyars. You are one: the last
in the town. All the others are dead.
As the last, you shall choose the manner
of your death."</p>

<p>"So you are the executioner,
Basil?"</p>

<p>"I? I am the chosen of my people."</p>

<p>With indescribable loathing, the
Magyar spat in his face.</p>

<p>"Scoundrel!" yelled the insulted
man, "for this you shall weep tears
of blood."</p>

<p>"Weep! I?&mdash;who ever saw me
weep? You may slay me, you may
torture me, or tear me limb from
limb. There are enough of you to do
it. But weep you shall not see me,
though you burst for impotent rage."</p>

<p>"Weep thou shalt, and 'tis I will
make thee. Know that it is I who
seduced your wife, and for whom she
betrayed you."</p>

<p>"That is thy shame, not mine."</p>

<p>"All thy kinsmen are slain."</p>

<p>"Better they should lie dead in the
street than breathe the same air with
thee."</p>

<p>"Thy property is annihilated."</p>

<p>"May God destroy those who did
it."</p>

<p>"Truly, thou art a cool fellow.
But&mdash;you had a daughter,&mdash;a fair and
innocent child."</p>

<p>George looked at his tormentor,
and shuddered.</p>

<p>"Lina, I think, was her name,"
continued the Serb, drawling out his
words with a refinement of cruelty.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what mean you?" asked
the trembling father.</p>

<p>"A comely maiden, by my word.
Fair to look upon, is she not?"</p>

<p>"The devil seize thee! What
next?"</p>

<p>"So young and delicate, and yet&mdash;six
husbands. Hard to choose. Your
wife could not decide to which she
should belong. I stepped in, and
settled the matter. I married her&mdash;to
all six&mdash;&mdash;" He burst into fiendish
laughter.</p>

<p>Mute and giddy with horror, the
father raised himself from the ground.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," continued the Serb,
"that you were not here for the
wedding."</p>

<p>"May God's justice fall upon you!"
shrieked the wretched father, stifling
his tears. But the parent's heart
overpowered the pride of the man.
He fell with his face upon the ground,
and wept&mdash;tears of blood.</p>

<p>"Lift him up," said Basil, "that
we may see him weep for the first
time in his life. Weep a little, George;
and you, sot, tune up your pipes, that
he may have accompaniment to his
tears."</p>

<p>And thereupon the drunken band
began to dance round their victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
with shouts of laughter and scoffing
gestures, striking and kicking him as
they passed. Now, however, he wept
no longer. He closed his eyes and
kept silence, enduring their ill-treatment
without sign or sound of complaint.</p>

<p>"Away with him!" cried Basil.
"Throw him into the garret, and put
a sentry over him. To-day we have
celebrated his daughter's wedding;
to-morrow we will drink at his funeral.
Good-night, friend George."</p>

<p>He was dragged up to the garret,
and locked in. Where they threw
him, there he lay, motionless upon the
floor, as though all sensation had
departed from both body and soul,
awaiting the hour of death, and rejoicing
that it was near at hand. For
a while the dancing and singing continued;
then the Serbs departed to
sleep, and all was still. His eyes
were unvisited by slumber. Yet a little
while, he thought to himself, and
eternal repose will be mine.</p>

<p>He lay with his senses thus benumbed,
thinking neither of the past
nor the future, when he heard a rustle
at the garret window. Through the
darkness he saw a white figure pass
through the small opening, and grope
its way towards him. Was it a
dream? or a reality? The figure's
steps were noiseless. But presently
it spoke&mdash;in a scarcely audible
whisper.</p>

<p>"Father! father!" it said.</p>

<p>"Lina!"</p>

<p>He looked up, seeking to discern
the features of his visitor. She hurried
to him, kissed him, and cut the
ropes that bound his hands.</p>

<p>"My child!" murmured George,
and clasped his daughter's tottering
knees. "My dear, my only child!"</p>

<p>"Let us fly!" said the maiden, in
faint and suffering tones. "The
ladder is at the window. Quick,
father&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>George clasped his panting child in
his arms, and bore her through the
opening in the garret roof, and down
the ladder, resting her head upon his
shoulder and covering her cold cheek
with his kisses. Near the ladder-foot,
he stumbled over something.
"What is that? A spade. We will
take it with us."</p>

<p>"For a weapon!" said the father.</p>

<p>"To dig a grave!" said the
daughter.</p>

<p>On the other side of the house was
heard a heavy monotonous step. It
was a Serb on sentry.</p>

<p>"Stay here! Keep close to the
wall," said George to his daughter.
He grasped the spade, and crept noiselessly
to the corner of the house. The
steps came nearer and nearer. George
raised the spade. The Serb turned
the corner, and&mdash;lay the next moment
upon the ground, with his skull
split. He had not time for a single
cry.</p>

<p>George took the dead man's clothes
and weapons, took his daughter in his
arms, and left the town. The morning
star glittered in the brightening
sky. Towards daybreak, and without
having exchanged a word, father and
daughter reached the nearest village.
George had many acquaintances
there, and with one of them, he
thought, he could leave his daughter.
He found but a poor reception. Nowhere
was he suffered to cross the
threshold. None offered him so much
as a crust of bread. All closed their
doors, and implored him to depart,
lest he should bring destruction on
their heads. The villagers were
neither hard-hearted nor cowardly;
but they feared that if the Serbs of St
Thomas heard of their sheltering a
fugitive, they also would be murdered
or plundered. With anguish in his
soul, the wretched man again took his
child in his arms, and resumed his
journey.</p>

<p>For six days he walked on, over
stubble and fallow, through storm and
cold by night and parching heat by
day&mdash;his child, his beloved child, on
his arm. He asked not what ailed
her; and she uttered no complaint.</p>

<p>On the sixth day the maiden died,
of hunger, misery, and grief.</p>

<p>The father felt his burthen heavier;
the arms that clasped his neck slackened
their hold, and the pale cheek
that nestled on his shoulder was
chill and cold!</p>

<p>But the spires of Szegedin now
glittered in the distance. George
hurried on, and at last, exhausted by
his speed, he reached at noonday the
large and populous city. In front of
it, on the vast plain, a great multitude
was assembled: more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
twenty thousand souls were gathered
together, listening to the words of a
popular orator, exalted upon a scaffolding
in their midst. George made
his way into the throng; the speaker
was relating the incredible atrocities
of the Raitzen. Several of his hearers
noticed the weary, wild-looking, travel-stained
man, carrying in his arms a
pale girl with closed eyes, who stood
amongst them like a fugitive from a
mad-house.</p>

<p>"Whence come you?" they asked
him.</p>

<p>"From St Thomas."</p>

<p>"Ha! Up! up with him on the
scaffold!" cried those who heard his
reply.</p>

<p>"A man is here from St Thomas.
Up with him, and let him speak to
the people!"</p>

<p>The crowd opened a passage, and
George was hurried to the scaffold.
When, from this elevation, his emaciated
and ghastly countenance, furrowed
by suffering and despair, his
failing limbs, and the faded and
ashy pale features of the child upon
his shoulder, became visible to the
assembled multitude, a deep shuddering
murmur ran through its masses,
like that the Platten Lake gives forth
when tempest nears its shores. At
sight and sound of the heaving
throng, a hectic flush flamed upon
George's cheek, an unwonted fire
burned in his bosom; he felt the spirit
of revenge descend upon his head like
a forked and fiery tongue.</p>

<p>"Magyars!" he exclaimed in loud
and manly tones, "I come from St
Thomas, the sole survivor of all who
there prayed to God in the Magyar
tongue. My goods are plundered, my
kinsmen slain. Have any of you
friends there?&mdash;prepare your mourning,
for of a surety they are dead.
Of all I possessed I have saved but
one treasure&mdash;my unhappy child.
Approach! ye that are fathers, think
of your virgin daughters, and behold
what they have made of mine!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he lifted his child
from his shoulder; and then only did
he perceive that she was dead.
Until that moment, he had thought
she was only faint and silent, as she
had constantly been for six days past.</p>

<p>"Dead!" shrieked the despairing
man, and clasped the corpse to his
heart. "She is dead!" he repeated.
The words died away upon his lips,
and he fell, like one thunderstruck,
headlong to the ground.</p>

<p>This tragical incident raised to a
climax the excitement of the multitude.</p>

<p>"Revenge!&mdash;a bloody revenge!"
thundered a voice; and the tumult
that now arose was like the howling
of the storm.</p>

<p>"To arms! To arms! all who are
men!" was shouted on every side,
and the people thronged through the
streets and lanes of the city. "To
arms!&mdash;to arms!" was re-echoed
from house to house, and in an hour's
time ten thousand furious men stood
armed and equipped, and ready to
set out for St Thomas.</p>

<p>Then there got abroad a sullen
apprehension, speedily succeeded by
a fierce resolve. Some one chanced
to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what if, when we march
away, the Raitzen rise up and murder
our children?"</p>

<p>The words passed from mouth to
mouth.</p>

<p>"They shall die!" exclaimed
many voices. "Let them perish, as
our brothers perished at St Thomas!
They must die!"</p>

<p>And with terrible ferocity the people
turned against their own city,
and like a mountain torrent, overpowering
all restraint, poured into
their neighbours' dwellings, and slew
the Raitzen to the very last man.</p>

<p>This occurred on the sixth day
after the extermination of the Magyars
at St Thomas.</p>


<h3>THE ROBBER-CAPTAIN.</h3>

<p>George took his dead child in his
arms, carried her into the forest, dug
a grave at the foot of a poplar tree,
and laid her in it. He lacked the
courage to throw clods upon her pale
and beautiful countenance, but he
plucked leaves and twigs from the
bushes, laid them thickly over her,
and then covered all with the black
earth. When the grave was filled
in, and whilst he was smoothing
the green moss over the mound,
anguish tore his heart; but, instead of
soothing tears, the fire of hell gleamed
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Then he took out his knife, to cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
his child's name on the bark of the
tree which was to be her living
monument. But when the letters
were complete, there stood, graven
by his own hand, the name of
<span class="smcap">Basil</span>. For he thought no longer of
his daughter, but of her murderer.
And more terribly significant than a
thousand curses and vows of vengeance,
was that name, graven in that
hour and that place.</p>

<p>George rose from the ground, and
wandered forth into the forest. He
had walked some distance, when a
longing desire came over him once
more to gaze upon his daughter's
grave. He turned to seek it, but the
trees were all alike: in vain he sought
the one beneath which his child lay
buried, and at last night overtook him
in the very heart of the forest. Still he
walked on, whither and wherefore he
knew not. The wood grew thicker,
and the night darker; the birds,
startled at his footsteps, flew screaming
from their perch. At last he
stumbled over a tree-root, and fell.
Why should he get up again? As
well there as anywhere. He let his
weary head sink upon the ground,
whispered a "good night" to his
child, and fell asleep, and dreamed
of burning towns and scenes of
slaughter.</p>

<p>Towards midnight the neighing of
a horse roused him from his restless
slumbers. Near at hand he saw a
saddle-horse, snorting and pawing the
ground. Behind some bushes he
heard a woman's plaintive tone, and
the harsher voice of a man, mingled
at intervals with the prattle of a
child.</p>

<p>The man was a short spare figure,
with flashing black eyes, long mustaches
hanging down over his mouth,
and black hair streaming on his
shoulders. Energy was the characteristic
of his features, and the sinews
of his frame were like cords of steel.</p>

<p>In his arms he held a child, three
or four years old. The child called
him father, and clasped him affectionately
with its little hands. A
woman was also there, sobbing passionately,
and wiping the tears from
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Canst thou pray, my son?" said
the man, seating the child upon his
knee.</p>

<p>"Surely he can," the woman answered;
"morning and evening he
repeats his prayer."</p>

<p>"Grow up a good man, my son&mdash;not
such a one as thy father. In
another year put him to school, that
he may learn something good."</p>

<p>"That will I, though it were to
cost me my last florin!"</p>

<p>"And take him far hence! When
he is older, never tell him what his
father was. Conceal my name from
him; never let him know that he is
the son of Rosa Sandor the robber."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>"Ask thy father, child, when he
will again visit us."</p>

<p>"I know not, my son. For me the
morning never dawns of which I can
say, this day is mine. Here to-day,
to-morrow fifty miles off; after to-morrow,
perhaps under the turf."</p>

<p>"Talk not thus! See, tears are in
the child's eyes."</p>

<p>"So is it, my son, and not otherwise.
The robber has none to whom
to pray, early and late, for protection
to his life."</p>

<p>"But you are no murderer, Sandor!
You have no man's blood upon your
hands!"</p>

<p>"Seek not to palliate my offence,
dear wench! Sooner or later, the
gallows and the ravens will claim
me."</p>

<p>Again the woman began to sob;
the child cried when it saw its mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>weep; with deep feeling the robber
caressed and comforted them.</p>

<p>"Go home, dear ones!" he said,
"and be not uneasy. Tell no one
that you have seen me. And His
blessing be upon you, whose blessing
I dare not ask!"</p>

<p>The woman and child departed.
The robber sprang into the saddle,
and, standing up in the stirrups,
listened, as long as they were audible,
to the infantine tones of his child.
Suddenly an icy-cold hand was laid
upon his. Startled, but without
uttering a sound, he turned his head.
A man stood beside his horse. It
was the fugitive from St Thomas.</p>

<p>"Fear nothing from me, Rosa!
Handle not your pistols. Mine shall
not be the first blood you shed. Not
to that end has your life been preserved
through sixteen years of peril.
Your destiny is not that of a common
malefactor."</p>

<p>"You know me, then?"</p>

<p>"By report, as an outlaw, with
a price upon your head. I know, too
that you have a beloved wife and a
darling child, to see whom once in
every year you risk your life&mdash;here,
where all know you, and any might
betray you."</p>

<p>"Not a word of that! You are ragged
and needy. Doubtless you would
enlist in my band. Here, take this"&mdash;he
offered him a pistol; "rather than do
that, send a bullet through your head."</p>

<p>The fugitive from St Thomas looked
earnestly in Sandor's face. Then he
said quietly, almost carelessly, "Do
my bidding, and the name of the
Robber shall no longer be coupled with
that of Rosa Sandor."</p>

<p>"Are you mad? Have I not done
my utmost? and in every quarter?
Let them pardon my past offences, and
they would hear of no new ones. The
traveller need no longer fear me.
Have I not offered to compensate to
the utmost of my power all those I
have injured, and to build, out of my
ill-gotten gains, a place of worship for
that God whose commandments I
have wilfully broken? All I ask is to
be suffered to live amongst my fellowmen,
and to earn my daily bread by
the labour of my hands. They would
never listen to my offers. There is
no atonement I am not willing to
make to the offended laws of God
and my country. But they ever
rejected and drove me forth. And
thou&mdash;what wouldst thou with me?&mdash;betray
me? Fly, wretch! Hitherto
I have shed no blood."</p>

<p>"Henceforward thou shalt shed it,
and thereby redeem thy crimes. Your
country accepts what the law refused.
Your country has foes; go, wash with
their blood the stain from your name!"</p>

<p>"Tempt me not!" said the robber
mournfully. "Ah, were it indeed
granted me to die a happy and honourable
death upon the battle-field!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if fame, instead of death,
awaited you there? And if, on your
return thence, the very men who now
chase you from forest to forest, came
forth to meet you with laurel crowns
and joyous acclamations; and if, instead
of "robber," hero and patriot
were coupled with your name?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! befool me not! Oh, I
could do much! A strong squadron
could I bring into the field, composed
of men who a hundred times have
looked death fearlessly in the face;
men inured to heat and cold, and to
back a horse for three days and nights
without dismounting."</p>

<p>"I will go and intercede for you."</p>

<p>"But what am I to thee? Who
art thou? And why wouldst thou
serve me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have my motives. I am
one whom the Raitzen have driven
from house and home, whose wife
they have seduced, whose kindred
they have slain. By flight alone did I
escape with my life; and here, in this
very forest, have I buried my only
child, polluted and murdered. All
these things have the Raitzen done to
me. Now, tell me, if you war against
them, you will give no quarter?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Then trust me that I will never
rest until I bring your pardon, on the
condition that you take the field
against the Raitzen with your whole
band. And may your happiness on
earth be measured by the destruction
you bring upon their accursed race."</p>

<p>"Clear me the path to the battle-field,
and you shall have a mountain
of your enemies' skulls."</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> do so. By all that is sacred,
I swear. In a fortnight I bring your
pardon. Where shall we meet?"</p>

<p>"We? nowhere. I trust no man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
If you be sincere, come to F&eacute;legyh&aacute;z.
There, in the tavern, sits each morning
a wrinkled old beggar, his grey
hair tied up in two knots. He has but
one hand&mdash;thereby will you know
him. Show him this pistol, and he
will conduct you to me. Seek not to
compel from him the secret of my
hiding-place, for no tortures could
wring it from his lips. Be not angry.
I must be cautious. For sixteen
years have I been hunted like a beast
of prey. And now away, and keep to
your right to find the path. An
opposite road is mine."</p>

<p>He set spurs to his horse, and galloped
off through the forest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fortnight had not expired
when George entered the tavern at
F&eacute;legyh&aacute;z.</p>

<p>In a dark corner, over a measure of
wine, sat the grey-haired, one-handed
beggar.</p>

<p>George showed the pistol. The
beggar rose from his seat, drank off his
wine, paid the tavern-keeper, and left
the house. Not a syllable escaped
him.</p>

<p>The two men stopped before a
wretched hut, at the extremity of the
village. The beggar went in, and
brought out two powerful black saddle-horses.
He signed to George to
mount one, whilst he himself sprang
upon the other, as actively as though
he were a young man and had both
hands.</p>

<p>Once fairly off, the old beggar became
talkative. These horses, he said,
were hacks of Rosa Sandor's, good
beasts enough; but the Captain's
favourite steed was far finer and better,
and would let none but its master
mount it, and would gallop for whole
days together without rest, or food, or
drink. It swam the Theiss thrice
running, and watched its master's
sleep like the most faithful dog,
neighing when danger approached.</p>

<p>Till late in the evening, they rode on
across the endless heath. No path
was there, nor visible landmark; only
at intervals a patch of stunted aspens,
and now and then a hut, whence proceeded
the hoarse bark of dogs, or a
sheep-pen vacant until nightfall.
There were fens overgrown with reeds
and rushes, and swarming with white
herons; and vast tracts of moor,
grazed and trampled by every sort of
cattle. Now and then, on the far
horizon, the travellers caught sight of
a steeple; or of a dark mass of wood,
coaxed by toil and care from the ungrateful
sandy soil.</p>

<p>At last night fell. All around grew
grey, and then black; but still the
old horse-herd kept steadily on his
way. In the remote distance a red
glimmer was seen: right and left
flamed the fires of the shepherds.</p>

<p>"Yonder is Rosa Sandor," said the
Bety&aacute;r, pointing to the distant light:
"there we shall find him."</p>

<p>Another hour brought them to the
place. As they drew near, the horses
that stood round the fire neighed
aloud, and the figures of three men
were visible. Their attitude was one
of watchfulness and determination.</p>

<p>A peculiar whistle from the lips of
the old Bety&aacute;r warned them of the
approach of friends.</p>

<p>One of the three men at the fire
was the robber chief, Rosa Sandor.</p>

<p>"What bring you?" asked Rosa.</p>

<p>"Your pardon!" cried George; and,
springing from his steaming horse, he
handed a sealed packet to his interrogator.
"Read and rejoice!"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The robber turned to the firelight, and
unfolded the document, which quivered
in his hand as he read it. One tear
and then another fell upon the paper;
slowly he bent his knees, and turned
his glistening eyes to heaven. "My
Lord and my God!" he exclaimed,
his utterance choked by sobs, "for
sixteen years I have been hunted like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>a wild beast, but Thou vouchsafest to
me to be once more a man!"</p>

<p>He turned to his companions. "To
horse!" he cried; "let the troop
assemble."</p>

<p>They sprang to their horses, and
soon upon all sides the signal-whistle
was heard. In ten minutes, a hundred
and eighty men, well mounted and
armed, mustered round the fire.</p>

<p>"Friends and comrades," cried
Sandor, "that which we have so long
desired has come to pass. We are no
longer robbers&mdash;our country pardons
us. It is granted us to atone our
crimes by an honourable death. Is
there one amongst you who does not
repent his past life, and rejoice to be
allowed to end it in honour?"</p>

<p>"Not one!" was the unanimous
shout.</p>

<p>"Will you follow me to the battle?"</p>

<p>"Everywhere! To death!"</p>

<p>"Swear it."</p>

<p>The vow was brief. "We joyfully
swear to shed our blood for our fatherland!"</p>

<p>"Add," said George to Rosa, "<i>and
to give no quarter</i>!"</p>


<h3>NOSTALGIA.</h3>

<p>The soldier is dying of home-sickness.</p>

<p>On a sudden an epidemic broke out
amongst the Hungarian troops stationed
in foreign lands.</p>

<p>A mysterious man wandered from
place to place, visiting the wine-houses
frequented by the hussars, and joining
in their conversation. The words he
spoke, repeated from mouth to mouth,
spread far and wide amongst the
light-hearted soldiers, whose light-heartedness
then suddenly left them.
The stranger told them of things
which had happened in their native
land; and, when he departed, he left
behind him printed verses and proclamations.
These the privates took
to their serjeants to have read to
them. When they heard them read
they wept and cursed, and learned by
heart both verse and prose, from the
first word to the last, and repeated
them from morning till night.</p>

<p>Then many took to their beds, and
neither ate nor drank; and when the
doctors asked what ailed them, they
pointed to their hearts, and said,
"Home! home!&mdash;let us go home!"</p>

<p>Many died, and no one could say
what had killed them. The rough
uneducated soldiers were pining away
in home-sickness, like flowers transplanted
to a foreign and ungenial soil.</p>

<p>An experiment was tried. Some
of the sick men received leave to go
home. The next day&mdash;they were
well and hearty.</p>

<p>It became known that some one
was at work secretly inoculating the
soldier with this strange malady;
but it was impossible to detect the
person.</p>

<p>The soldiers!&mdash;oh, not one of <i>them</i>
would betray him; and all snares
were laid in vain. With the officers
he never meddled. The private soldiers
were his men. With them he
felt himself secure from treachery.
And the seed he scattered abroad
produced an abundant harvest.</p>

<p>The dejection of the troops became
daily more striking. The soldiers
grew wild and intractable. No longer,
when riding their horses to water,
did they sing, as had been their wont,
joyous ditties in praise of wine and
women. Their songs were now sad
and strange-sounding; mournful words
to yet more dismal tunes. They sang
of their country, of their dear native
land, and of strife and bloodshed, in
dirge-like strains; and the burden of
every couplet was "<i>Eljen Magyar!</i>"
Like the last accents of a dying man
were the tones they uttered, sinking
deeper and deeper, and ending in
piteous long-protracted cadences.</p>

<p>Still are such songs to be heard in
Hungary's forests, and around her villages,
in the silent night-time. Now,
more than ever, do they sound like
funeral dirges, and their long sad
notes like wailings from the grave.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a small Gallician town was
quartered a division of hussars&mdash;splendid
fellows, for whom the heart of
many a Polish maiden beat quicker
than its wont. The most beautiful
woman in all the neighbourhood loved
the best blade amongst the hussars&mdash;the
Captain.</p>

<p>Countess Anna K&mdash;nsky, the lovely
Polish widow, had been for six months
betrothed to the bold hussar officer,
and the wedding-day was near at
hand. A single night intervened. On
the eve of the happy day, the bridegroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
went to visit his bride. He
was a tall slender man, with the
bloom of youth still upon his face; but
his high forehead was already bald;&mdash;"Sun
and moon together," as the
Hungarian proverb says.</p>

<p>The bride was a fair and delicate
lady, with abundant black locks, a
pale nervous countenance, and blue
eyes of that unusual lustre which one
finds only in Polish blue eyes. At
sight of her lover, her alabaster cheek
was overspread with the roses of
love's spring-time, and her eyes beamed
like the rising sun.</p>

<p>The bridegroom would fain have
appeared cheerful; but it is hard to
deceive the gaze of love, which reads
the beloved one's trouble in each fold
of the brow, in each absent glance of
the eye. Tenderly she approached
him, smoothed his forehead's wrinkles
with her hand, and imprinted a kiss
in their place. But again they returned.</p>

<p>"What ails thee, dearest? How
is this? Sad on the eve of our wedding-day?"</p>

<p>"I? Nothing ails me. But I am
annoyed at an incident&mdash;a casualty&mdash;which
I cannot postpone. The court-martial
has condemned a man to
death. I have just now signed the
sentence. The man is to be shot to-morrow:
just on our bridal-day! I
would it were otherwise!"</p>

<p>"The man is doubtless a criminal?"</p>

<p>"According to military law. He
has been debauching soldiers from
their duty&mdash;exciting them to desert
and return home to fight the Serbs.
Death is the penalty of his crime."</p>

<p>"And you have signed the sentence?
Are you not a Magyar?
Love you not your native land?"</p>

<p>"I am a soldier before everything.
I respect the laws."</p>

<p>"Impossible! You, who love so
well, cannot be devoid of that most
ennobling kind of love&mdash;patriotism."</p>

<p>"I can love, but I cannot dream.
Of the maxims and principles of revolutionists,
I understand not a word;
but thus much I know, revolutions
never end well. Much blood, little
honour, eternal remorse."</p>

<p>"Say not eternal remorse, but
eternal hope. Hope that a time <i>must</i>
come, which will compensate all sufferings
and sacrifices."</p>

<p>The fair enthusiast quitted her
bridegroom's side, seated herself at
the piano, and played with feverish
energy the well-known song,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Noch ist Polen nicht verloren!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>her eyes flashing through tears. Her
lover approached her, removed her
hand, which trembled with emotion,
from the keys of the instrument, and
kissed it.</p>

<p>"Poor Poland! Well may thy
daughters weep over thy fate; but
alas! in vain. I was lately in Pesth.
Passing along a street where a large
house was building, I noticed amongst
the labourers a woman, carrying
stones to and fro upon her head, for
the use of the masons. Twice&mdash;thrice&mdash;I
passed before her. The
sweat streamed from her face; her
limbs could scarcely support her. She
was no longer young, and the toil
was severe. This woman once possessed
a palace in Warsaw&mdash;far, far
more magnificent than the house she
was then helping to build. Its portals
were surmounted by a prince's
coronet; and many are the joyous
hours I have spent beneath its hospitable
roof.... When, at the
sound of the noonday bell, she seated
herself at her wretched meal, I accosted
her. For a long time she
would not recognise me; then she
turned away her head and wept. The
other women only laughed at her. I
offered her money; she thanked me,
and took very little. She, once the
mistress of millions, besought me to
send the remainder to her little
daughter, whom she had left a dependant
on a rich family in a distant
town. I promised to seek out her
daughter. When I had last seen her
she was a lovely child, six years of
age. Eight years had elapsed, bringing
her to the verge of womanhood.
I reached the house. In answer to
my inquiries, a girl appeared&mdash;not
that fair and delicate being whose
sweet countenance still dwelt in my
memory, but a rude creature, with
hard coarse features and wild eyes.
She did not recognise me, often
though she had seen me. I spoke to
her in Polish; she understood not a
word. I asked after her mother; she
stared vacantly in my face....
Truly, the fate of Poland is a terrible
example of what a nation may expect
from its neighbours when it engages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
in a struggle with one more powerful
than itself; and woe to the Magyar
if he does not profit by the warning!"</p>

<p>"Ah! it is no Magyar who can
talk thus!"</p>

<p>"Anna! thy first husband fell in
battle on the morrow of thy wedding
day. Wouldst thou lose thy second
bridegroom on its eve?"</p>

<p>"I? With contrition I avow my
culpable weakness; I love you more
than my country, more than liberty.
Until to-day, no man ever heard
these words from a Polish woman.
<i>I</i> wish you to sacrifice yourself? Did
you seek to do so, I should surely
hold you back&mdash;which no Polish wife
ever yet did to her husband. All I
crave of you is to leave that man his
life, whose patriotism was stronger
than your own. On our bridal eve,
I ask you for a man's life as a wedding-gift."</p>

<p>"And a soldier's honour!"</p>

<p>"Punish him otherwise."</p>

<p>"There is but one alternative. The
man has instigated mutiny and desertion;
the law has doomed him to
death. I must execute the sentence,
or fly with him to Hungary. And
thence, I well know, I should never
return. In a case like this, the judge
punishes, or is an accomplice of the
criminal. In one hand I have the
sword of justice, in the other the banner
of insurrection. Choose! which
shall I raise?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sky was scarcely reddened by
the dawn when the prisoner was led
forth to execution. Silently, without
other sound than that of their horses'
hoofs, marched the square of hussars.
In the centre, on an open cart, was
the chaplain, a crucifix in his hand;
and beside him, in a white shirt, bare-headed
and with fettered hands, the
culprit, George of St Thomas.</p>

<p>The sun rose as they reached the
appointed place. The plumes of the
hussars and the grey locks of the condemned
man fluttered in the morning
breeze. They took him from the
cart: six hussars dismounted and unslung
their carbines; the remainder
formed up. The adjutant unfolded a
paper and read, in a stern and merciless
voice, the sentence of death passed
upon George of St Thomas. According
to customary form, a soldier
stepped up to the adjutant, presented
him with a wand, and thrice implored
mercy for the condemned man. The
third time the officer broke the wand
in two, threw it at the criminal's feet,
and said in solemn tones, "God is
merciful!"</p>

<p>At these words the doomed man
raised his head; his attitude grew more
erect, his features glowed. He gazed
around him in the faces of the assembled
soldiers, then upwards at the
purple clouds, and spoke in enthusiastic
tones.</p>

<p>"Thank thee, O God!" he said;
"and thanks also to you, comrades,
for my death. Life has long been a
burthen to me; death is welcome. I
have lost everything&mdash;wife and child,
house and home; my country alone
remained to me, and her I could not
free. I rejoice to die. You, comrades,
bless God, that yonder, beyond
the mountains, you have a mother, a
beloved bride, a faithful wife, an infant
child, waiting your return.
Yonder beyond the mountains you
have your homes, your cottages, your
families. Pray to God that at your
last hour you may welcome death as
joyfully as I, who have nothing left
upon earth." He paused, and sank
upon his knees, as if power had departed
from his limbs.</p>

<p>The soldiers stood motionless as
statues. The adjutant waved the
paper in his hand. Gloomily the six
hussars raised their carbines.</p>

<p>Once more the adjutant raised the
folded paper, when behold! a young
non-commissioned officer dashed out
of the ranks, snatched the fatal document
from his hand, tore it, and
threw the fragments at the feet of the
firing-party.</p>

<p>Two hundred sabres flashed from
their scabbards, and, amidst a cloud
of dust, two hundred chargers scoured
across the plain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The wedding guests were waiting.
The bridegroom was there in full uniform,
glittering with gold, and the
beauteous bride in her graceful robe
of white lace. Yet a moment, and
she would be his wedded wife.</p>

<p>The moment was very long.</p>

<p>The bridegroom awaited his adjutant's
return from the execution.
Until then, he would not approach the
altar.</p>

<p>What if, at the very instant the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
solemn Yes! passed his lips, there
reached his ears the rattle of the
life-destroying volley, which he, the
thrice happy lover, had commanded?</p>

<p>What if, whilst God's servant implored
Heaven's blessing on their union,
the angry spirit of the criminal, invoking
vengeance on his judge's head,
appeared at the footstool of the Almighty?</p>

<p>Still no adjutant came.</p>

<p>The bridegroom was uneasy. Yet
uneasier grew the bride.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she whispered, "it were
better to postpone the ceremony."</p>

<p>"Or," he replied, "to hasten it."</p>

<p>A foreboding of evil oppressed them
both.</p>

<p>And still the adjutant came not.
Two, three hours elapsed beyond the
appointed time. Noon approached;
each minute seemed an eternity.</p>

<p>At last hoofs clattered in the court.
Hasty steps and jingling spurs were
heard upon the stairs. All eyes were
fixed upon the door.... It opened,
the adjutant appeared, pale, dusty,
exhausted, the sweat streaming over
his face.</p>

<p>"Remain without!" cried the
bridegroom. "You bring a message
of death&mdash;enter not here!"</p>

<p>"No message of death do I bring,"
replied the officer hoarsely, "but a
hundred times worse. The condemned
man has taken the hussars away with
him, all, towards the Hungarian
frontier. A couple of leagues off
they released me to make my report!"</p>

<p>"My horse!" shouted the bridegroom,
hurrying madly to the door.
But he paused at sight of his bride,
paler than ever and with terror in her
glance.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Wait but a moment</span>, dearest
love!" he said, clasped her to his
breast, kissed her, and threw himself
on his horse.</p>

<p>The animal reared beneath him and
would not leave the court. The rider
struck the spurs sharply into its flanks.
Once more he looked back. There
she stood, the beloved one, in her
bridal dress upon the balcony, and
waved her kerchief. "You will soon
be back," she said.</p>

<p>She never saw him again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Forward raced the hussars upon
their rapid coursers, forward towards
the blue mountains&mdash;ever forward.</p>

<p>Through forest wildernesses, over
pathless heaths, up hill and down&mdash;ever
forwards to the distant mountains.</p>

<p>Right and left steepled cities appeared
and vanished; the vesper bells
greeted them as they passed; loudly
neighing, their horses swept along,
swift and ever swifter.</p>

<p>Amongst them rode the gray-headed
man, guiding them by untrodden
paths, over swamp and moor,
through silent groves of pine, forwards
to the mountains.</p>

<p>In the evening twilight they reach
the banks of a stream. Here and
there on the distant hills glimmer the
shepherds' fires; beyond those hills
lies the Magyar's home, and in their
valleys this stream takes its rise.
Here, for the first time, they dismount,
to water their horses in the
wave whose source is in their native
land.</p>

<p>Whilst the horses sup the cool
stream, their riders strike up that gay
and genial song, whose every note
brings memories of home,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hei! auch ich bin dort geboren,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wo der Stern dort strahlt."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Who ever rode so merrily to death?</p>

<p>But the vedettes make sudden sign
that some one comes.</p>

<p>In the distance a horseman is seen;
his steed vies in swiftness with the
wind, his long plume and laced pelisse
stream behind, the gold upon his
schako glitters in the red sun-rays.</p>

<p>"The Captain!" is murmured
around.</p>

<p>The hussars mount, draw their
sabres, form line, and when their
captain appears in their front, they
offer him the customary salute.</p>

<p>Breathless with fury and speed, at
first he cannot speak. Motionless
in front of the line, his sabre quivering
in his hand, he is at a loss for words
to express his indignation. Before
he can find them, four hussars quit
the ranks; the youngest&mdash;the same
who tore up the sentence&mdash;raises his
hand to his schako, and addresses his
chief.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Captain! You come
at the right moment to accompany us
to Hungary. Short time is there for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>deliberation. Decide quickly. We
will seize your horse's bridle, and take
you with us by force. Well do we
know that you come willingly; but so
will you avoid disgrace, should defeat
be our lot. You must with us&mdash;by
force. If we succeed, yours the
glory; if we fall, the guilt is ours,
since we compel you. Play your
part! Defend yourself! Cut one or
two of us from our saddles, the first
who lays hand on your rein&mdash;see, I
grasp it! Strike, Captain, and with
a will."</p>

<p>He did as he said, and seized the
horse's bridle; whilst, on the other
side, an old serjeant laid hand on its
mane. The horse stirred not.</p>

<p>The Captain gazed hard at them,
each in turn; but he raised not his
sabre to strike. Behind him his forsaken
bride, before him the mountain
frontier of his native land. On the
one hand, a heaven of love and happiness;
on the other, glory and his
country's cause. Two mighty passions
striving against each other with
a giant's force. The fierce conflict
went nigh to overpower him; his
head sank upon his breast. Suddenly
blared the trumpets in rear of the
squadron; at the martial sound his
eager war-horse bounded beneath him.
With awakening enthusiasm the
rider raised his head and waved his
sabre.</p>

<p>"Forward, then," he cried, "in
God's name!"</p>

<p>And forward he sprang into the
river, the two hussars by his side;
the cloven waters plashing in pearls
around their heads.</p>

<p>Forward, forward to the blue
mountains!</p>

<p>In lengthening column, the hussars
followed across the stream&mdash;the horses
bravely breasting the flood, the bold
riders singing their wild Magyar
ditty. But dark and gloomy was
their leader's brow, for each step led
him farther from happiness and his
bride.</p>

<p>In the midst of the troop rode
George of St Thomas, in his hand
the banner of Hungary. His cheek
glowed, his eye flashed: each step
brought him nearer to revenge.</p>

<p>The troubled stream is once more
stilled, the fir-wood receives the fugitives,
their horses' tramp dies away in
the darkness. Here and there, from
the distant mountains, the herdsman's
horn resounds; on their flanks
the shepherd's fire gleams like a blood-red
star.</p>

<p>Forward, forward!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Back to thy lair, bloodthirsty
monster, back and sleep!</p>

<p>Let the forest-grass grow over the
ensanguined plain.</p>

<p>How much is destroyed, how much
has passed away.</p>

<p>How many good men, who were
here, are here no longer; and how
many who remain would grieve but
little if they, too, were numbered
with the dead.</p>

<p>The hero of battles is once more a
robber and a fugitive. The iron hand
of the law drives him from land's end
to land's end.</p>

<p>In the mad-house mopes a captain
of hussars, and ever repeats,&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Wait
but a moment!</span>" None there can
guess the meaning of his words.</p>

<p>Only George of St Thomas is
happy. He sleeps in a welcome
grave, dreaming of sweet renown and
deep revenge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have suppressed two chapters
of this tale, both for want of space,
and because they are unpleasantly
full of horrors. They are chiefly occupied
with the vengeance wreaked by
George, who is frightfully mutilated in
the course of the war, upon the Serbs,
and especially upon his deadly foe
Basil; and include an account of the
capture by assault, and subsequent
conflagration, of the town of St
Thomas. They are in no way essential
to heighten or complete the interest
of those we have given; and
<i>L'Envoy</i> is as appropriately placed at
the end of the third chapter as at the
close of the fifth. The plot of the
whole tale, if such it may be called,
is quite unimportant; but there is an
originality and a wild vigour in many
of the scenes, which justify, in combination
with other German translations
from the Magyar that have
lately reached us, an anticipation of
yet better things from the present
generation of Hungarian poets and
novelists.</p>

"The Serbs first aimed the poniard at their German and Magyar neighbours....
Isolated scenes of murder, perpetrated by the Serbs against the Magyars and Germans,
who inhabit that district, (the Bacska, or country of Bacs, between the Danube
and the Theiss,) led the way to a series of sanguinary atrocities, such as our age had
hoped never to see repeated. The commencement of hostilities is due to the Sclavo-Wallachian
race; old, long-restrained hate, combined with an innate thirst for blood,
marked the rising of the South Sclavonian races from the first as one of the bloodiest
character, in which murder was both means and end. No revolution of modern times&mdash;the
great French Revolution not excepted&mdash;is blackened with such horrible atrocities
as this: the details may be found in the Serbian and Magyar journals; and one
would fain have hoped that the accounts on both sides were exaggerated. Unhappily,
such a hope is illusory; nor can the historian indulge it without falsifying the
truth. Deeds have been perpetrated which call to mind the Hurons and Makis of
the American forests. Like them, the Serbs were masters in the art of torture and
murder; like them, they made their unhappy victims previously undergo all the
dreadful steps of torment, prolonging the transition from life to death with a refinement
of cruelty; like them, they vaunted the deeds of horror, and honoured their
executioners as heroes.... Such unheard-of atrocities inevitably called forth retaliation.
Magyars and Germans became savages among savages."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Schlesinger</span>,
Pulsky's edition, i. 22-24.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Schlesinger describes Rosa Sandor as "a man about thirty-five years of age
not very tall or stout, with fair hair, small mustaches and whiskers, and with nothing
of the bandit in his appearance or demeanour," but mentions that he had a
lieutenant of the popular bandit type, a broad-shouldered truculent personage with
a formidable black beard, and long hair streaming on his shoulders. "A strange
relation," he adds, "exists between the two men. The master was anxious, for
reasons easy to conceive, that his person should not be generally known in the
country; whilst the servant, on the contrary, had vanity enough to take pleasure in
passing for the famous Rosa Sander. All the portraits of the latter which are
circulated throughout the country are faithful likenesses of the lieutenant, and hence
the common erroneous notion of the Captain."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Rosa Sandor was less a highwayman than a cattle-lifter, and pursued his
vocation in the neighbourhood of Szegedin. "He was never in prison," says
Schlesinger, "but repented his misdemeanours of his own free will, and wrote to the
magistrates stating that he would leave their cattle alone, if they would pardon him
for the past and allow him to pursue the Austrians." The Hungarian Government
granted his request, and he did good service, especially against Jellachich and the
Serbs; and also repeatedly entered Pesth and Komorn with despatches, when those
places were closely invested by the Austrians.&mdash;See Schlesinger, i. 226-8, for other
particulars of this Hungarian Robin Hood, who was at the head of a band of three
hundred men, and was further remarkable by his abstinence from bloodshed.</p></div>

<p>We hear a great deal at the present
day, not only from pretended philanthropists,
but from well-meaning
and conscientious people, about the
"Rights of Labour." In fact, the
term has become so hackneyed that
very rarely is any popular speech delivered
from a hustings, or elsewhere,
without its occurrence as a marked
and leading principle, which the
speaker is determined to uphold.</p>

<p>But general terms are almost always
susceptible of wide and contradictory
construction; and when we come
to analyse this phrase, "the rights of
labour," and to consider the different
interpretations which have been
passed upon it, we are forced to arrive
at the conclusion, that very few of
those who use the words have any
distinct idea of the meaning which
they ought to convey. One man
considers "the rights of labour" as
identical with the operation of the
maxim which exhorts us "to buy in
the cheapest, and to sell in the dearest
market." Another defines those
rights to mean, "a fair day's wage
for a fair day's labour." And so the
term is bandied about among us, repeated
and reiterated, until it has
fairly lost the semblance of anything
like clear significance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile labour, in this country
at least, is loudly calling for the recognition
of its rights, whatever
those rights may be&mdash;not for the
shadow, but the substance; not for
the name, but for the reality. Labour
in Ireland is struck down and paralysed&mdash;paralysed
in its first natural
function and duty, the production of
food, although millions of acres, capable
of yielding large returns of cereal produce,
are either unbroken or withdrawn
from the tillage of the plough.
Labour in Scotland is becoming daily
less remunerative; the northern population
is driven to emigrate by thousands,
or to take refuge in the cities
and towns already redundantly supplied.
Wages are decreasing in the
Lowlands; the poor-rate is multiplying
fast; and the greatest source of
our wealth, the iron trade, is in a state
of lamentable prostration. Labour
in England, by far the richest country
of the three, is scarcely better remunerated.
In the rural districts, we
hear of lowered agricultural wages
and growing discontent; in the towns,
we are told of mills closed or put upon
short time; and, from the metropolis
and the larger cities, we have accounts
of misery and destitution which, did they
reach us from missionaries in a heathen
land, would fill our souls with horror,
and our hearts with righteous indignation.</p>

<p>To that call, proceeding from the
labourers themselves, we cannot and
we dare not turn a deaf ear. We
must listen to it, appalling as it is;
and examine into the cause of it, if we
wish society to remain as it has been.
We must allow no preconceived ideas or
impressions, generated, perhaps, by
the delusions of the last few years,
or of many years, to stand in our
way when so frightful a calamity approaches
as the destitution and demoralisation
of the working and producing
classes of this mighty empire;
for we may as well expect a fabric to
stand after its foundations have been
worn away, as suppose that a state
can exist without the support of those
who are, in reality, the artificers of
its whole wealth and produce.</p>

<p>Would to heaven we could persuade
men to throw aside, not for a time,
but for ever, their party notions, and,
what is still more difficult, their selfish
interests; and induce them to look
this great question broadly and fairly
in the face! They will not find it
treated of in their politico-economical
treatises&mdash;those wretched collections
of sophisms compiled by the dullest
and most blear-eyed of mankind,
which have been accepted in our day
as monuments of transcendent wisdom.
They will not find the question
mooted at all in the tomes of their
conceited statists: but if they step
beyond that dreary range, and go
forth into the scenes of busy life, they
will hear it discussed, always eagerly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>sometimes ably, sometimes incompetently,
in the workshop, the forge, the
factory, the cottage, and the mine;
and they may then form some idea of
the importance which the working-classes
attach to that much-abused
term&mdash;"the Rights of Labour."</p>

<p>The mere general discussion of such
a point implies that there is something
amiss, either in our social or
in our commercial and national system.
With regard to the first, we
think there can be no argument.
Unless some totally new evangel has
been reserved for these latter days,
Socialism, as it is understood on the
Continent, and even partially among
ourselves, is a wild and miserable
delusion. It has been tried, over
and over again, under circumstances
far more favourable for its development
than any which are likely to
occur again, and has invariably
failed. Nay, the tendency of Liberalism
has been to sweep what modified
Socialism might exist in a civilised
community away. Guilds, corporations,
the chartered privileges of
burghs, have all vanished, or been
reduced to shadows, and nothing is
now permitted to stand between the
employer and the employed. Socialism,
through the law, can have no
existence. It may, indeed, lawfully
rear and extend itself, if it can, on its
own simple merits; but, tried by that
test, it simply resolves itself into a
new form of labour, liable to competition
as before, and powerless to
affect prices, by which labour must
ever be estimated.</p>

<p>Our firm and fixed belief is, that
what are termed social grievances are
simply the consequence of a faulty or
erroneous commercial and national
system. Vapid and superficial writers
have talked a great deal about what
they are pleased to call the "<i>Laissez-faire</i>"
tendencies of modern statesmen&mdash;intending
thereby to convey the
impression that Government is not
active enough in its regulating and
modifying functions. According to
our view, this is a most unfounded
charge, as against either the Government
or the Legislature. We can
discern no lack of activity&mdash;no want
of interference: on the contrary, we
are inclined to complain that changes
are too common and rapid. This is
an evil to which governments, based
on the popular representative principle,
are peculiarly liable; and the
skill and prescience of the modern
statesman will be more conspicuously
shown in restraining than in encouraging
the spirit of change. Why
complain of want of activity, or of
culpable negligence, when the fact is
before us that, during the last few
years, the whole of our commercial
system has undergone a radical
change, which has affected, more or
less, every source of labour, every
branch of industry, every application
of capital throughout the British
empire? We have been the reverse
of idle, both at home and abroad.
At home, not one single interest has
escaped the ordeal of experiment;
abroad, we have subjected the colonies
to forced operations, from the
effects of which it is exceedingly
doubtful if they can ever rally, at
least under our tutelary care.</p>

<p>These alterations and changes were
no doubt intended by their devisers
to be productive of good, but they
may in reality have been productive
of evil. It is impossible to foretell
with certainty the effect of any sweeping
change, even when the elements
of calculation appear to be within
our own control. When they are
beyond it&mdash;as must be the case whenever
we assume the co-operation of
foreign independent powers, without
securing it by treaty&mdash;the uncertainty
is still greater. It cannot be
denied that the late commercial
changes proceeded upon the assumption
of reciprocity, and that this
assumption has been proved by experience
to be utterly wrong. So far,
then, they have not answered the
expectations of their framers. Free
imports may be advantageous or the
reverse; but they have at all events
failed in producing reciprocity, and in
converting foreign nations to our insular
commercial doctrines. It would be,
to say the least of it, becoming in those
who advocate the maintenance of the
present system to remember this, and
to mitigate the arrogance of their
tone; for, undeniably, the most important
half of their prophecy has
fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>Still it remains to be seen whether,
in spite of the absence of the promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
reciprocity, we have derived any
material advantage from the change;
and here men will differ according to
their methods of estimation. Those
who are determined, at all hazards, to
cry up the advantages of Free Trade,
will point to a balance-sheet of extended
exports as a sure index of the prosperity
of the nation. Is it, after all,
a sure index? The whole amount of
our national exports is but an infinitesimal
portion of the annual creation
of wealth in the country; it consists
of the products of only a few
branches of industry, and represents
the employment, not of the masses of
the population, but merely of a small
section. Some of these branches, indeed
the most important of them, do
not possess the first guarantee for
stability and endurance. <i>They depend
for their existence entirely upon the
supply of foreign material.</i> But for the
cotton-wool of America, the factories
of Lancashire would be shut up; and
we shall presently have occasion to
inquire what likelihood there is of an
extended, or even a continued supply.
Increased exports give us no account
whatever of internal and home consumption.
During the last year,
with a limited supply of raw material,
owing to a deficient crop, we
have sent away more cotton goods
than before. What is the natural inference
from that, as to the capabilities
of the home consumer?</p>

<p>Neither is it fair to select any two
or three branches of industry which
may be flourishing, and to parade
these as an index of the prosperity of
the whole country. If Free-Trade had
not been productive of advantage to
<i>some</i> classes, it would not have been
tolerated so long. We know perfectly
well, and are prepared to admit, that
at this moment some trades are doing
well; <i>but then they are thriving at the expense
of the great body of the community</i>.
Such, for example, is the linen-trade
of Dundee, supported at the present
time by a large demand from abroad
for coarse textures, the origin of
which demand may be traced to the
Free-Trade measures. That cheap
provisions, owing to the imports from
abroad, should be a great advantage
to the operatives engaged in this kind
of manufacture, will admit of no
doubt; but how does that affect the
general prosperity of the nation? Those
operatives work for the foreigner, and
are fed by the foreigner. Their contributions
to the national revenue,
through the customs' duties and excise,
cannot be taken as an equivalent
for their decreased consumption of
British agricultural produce; yet how
often is such an instance as this paraded
as a proof of general prosperity!
After all, it is, perhaps, the only
branch of importance which is prospering
at the present time. The woollen
trade has been steady, but not more
profitable than before. The cotton
trade we know to be depressed; and
the iron trade, one of our most valuable
staples, because the raw materials
of the coal and ore, as well as the manufactured
article, are of British production,
is at present worse than unprofitable.</p>

<p>We state these things, not as proofs
of the inefficacy of Free Trade, but
simply as tending to show that no
sound inferences as to the general prosperity
of the country can be drawn
from the fact that exports have increased.
The only criterion is, and
must be, the condition of the working
classes. We have already pointed
out the vast depreciation of labour,
and the want of employment
which is visible over the three kingdoms;
and we have alluded to the two
most formidable symptoms&mdash;pauperism
and extended emigration. How
these unchallenged and admitted facts
are reconcilable with the idea of general
prosperity, it remains for our philosophers
to show.</p>

<p>To what, then, is this owing? We
can only attribute it to one cause&mdash;the
total disregard of the interests of
the British producer. Politicians may
attempt, as they have heretofore done,
to explain away evident and startling
facts on trivial and insufficient grounds;
journalists may affect to sneer at the
representations of the sufferers, and
to turn their complaints into derision;
economists may offer to prove the fitness
of existing circumstances, upon
certain immutable laws of which they
were the sole discoverers; demagogues
may strive to divert attention
from the lamentable consequences of
their misdeeds by attacking other institutions;
but the fact of general depression
and distress remains uncontroverted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and incapable of denial; and
so it will remain until the national policy
is altered.</p>

<p>It is now precisely twelve months
ago since we drew the attention of
the public to the actual state of British
agriculture under the operation of
Free-Trade prices. We then, and in
subsequent articles, quoted the deliberate
opinion of those who favoured
and carried the repeal of the Corn
Laws, as to what remunerative prices
in reality were; we called as witnesses
the late Sir Robert Peel, Mr
Wilson, M.P. for Westbury, and
others&mdash;and showed that, according
to their judgment, not that of Protectionists,
wheat could not be grown
with a profit in this country unless it
commanded in the market from 12s.
to 16s. more per quarter than was at
that time the average of England.
We were told in reply, by our antagonists,
that the depression was merely
accidental. Hardly one of them ventured
to say that they had anticipated
such a result, or that such a result
was desirable: on the contrary, the
farmers of this country were told to
believe that the low prices current
were simply the consequences of an
exuberant harvest, combined with
the first impulse of new importation,
and that, from sheer want of material,
the latter would speedily subside.
At the close of another year,
and after another harvest materially
differing in quality, we find prices
actually lower than they were at this
time twelvemonths. Nor is this the
case with grain alone, but with cattle:
thus demonstrating how hopeless is
the condition of the British farmer
under the operation of the present
law.</p>

<p>That the impending ruin of the
agriculturists, who constitute by far
the most important body of British
producers, and therefore of consumers
in the home market, would speedily
react upon every branch of industry,
we foresaw and foretold; and the
result is now before us, evident in
each day's reiterated tale of distress.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, we are
assured in certain quarters, that at
every hazard the experiment must
go on; that, having once embarked in
a career, however dangerous, we must
persevere to the last; and that protection
to native industry is inconsistent
with the genius of a free and
enlightened people.</p>

<p>Let us see whether it be so. And,
as to judge of this question we must
look elsewhere than to Britain, let us
try to discover the extent to which
the principles of Free Trade are
acknowledged in other lands, where
freedom, both of sentiment and action,
is claimed quite as enthusiastically as
in our own. It is worth while knowing
how far our opinions on this commercial
subject have been responded
to, not by despotic states, wherein
the popular voice might be suppressed,
but by the most liberal and enterprising
countries, which, we were told,
waited only for our example to engage
in the work of reciprocity.</p>

<p>Among these we are surely entitled
to reckon Switzerland and Germany&mdash;including
in the latter denomination
that powerful confederacy, the Zollverein,
which embraces the Hanseatic
towns. These are Protectionist&mdash;determined
at all hazards to maintain
their doctrine of fostering native
industry, and meeting us, not with
reciprocity, but with augmented customs'
duties. The following extracts
from the last modifications of the
general tariff of the Zollverein may
be instructive:&mdash;</p>

<p>The law which gave a tariff to
Switzerland on the 30th of June 1849,
commences by enacting "that all the
articles which are imported into
Switzerland, are, with certain exceptions,
specified by the present law,
submitted to an import duty," and
proceeds to impose duties of various
kinds on all conceivable articles of
importation. So far from being in
favour of Free Trade, the Swiss
nation is distinctly opposed to it;
because, as in France, the people
engaged in those important branches
of industry are fully alive to their
interest, and exercise the power they
possess to render the revenue laws
subservient to it.</p>

<p>Next comes France, upon the example
of which country, and its reciprocal
sentiments, Mr Cobden almost
perilled his case, when he undertook
his crusade to stir up that enthusiasm
for free imports which, according to
his view, lay burning at the heart of
every people throughout the civilised
globe. We have reason to know
that the accounts of his reception in
France, which appeared in many of
the London journals, were absurdly
exaggerated; and that, beyond the
circle of that small and despised
clique of whom M. Bastiat is or
was the head, it was the reverse of
flattering, until he arrived at Bordeaux.
There, indeed, the winegrowers
of the Gironde prepared an
ovation for the statesman who had
opened&mdash;or rather who, it was hoped,
would open&mdash;the ports of England to
the produce of their generous vintage.
But when, in answer to one of his
entertainers, more practical or suspicious
than the rest, the hero of the
League was compelled to avow his
opinion that wine was a fair subject
for taxation, the disheartening announcement
was made that, if the
wine duties were not repealed, Bordeaux
did not interest itself at all in
the question of Free Trade. Nor can
we at this moment discover a country
visited by Mr Cobden, whatever may
be its form of government, that has
fulfilled those "confident expectations"
which he announced with
such singular energy. It cannot be
said that democracy has made no progress
in Europe since 1846. The gallant
and mighty people of France are now
in full enjoyment of all the rights
of man, and have only to indicate
their will to their representative
governors, and it is obeyed. Have,
then, free imports followed in the train
of liberty? Englishmen are not
likely soon to forget how the enfranchised
people of France first made
use of their newly acquired power;
and, though with steadier and more
regular action, the great French Republic
has held on its protective
course up to the recent opening of
its Chamber, heedless alike of the
lectures of M. Bastiat, or the example
of England. Indeed, there
appears to be a tacit agreement on
this one subject among all statesmen
and all parties. Once, it is true, the
eloquent though unsuccessful voice
of M. de Lamartine was heard prophesying,
in mystical phrase, the
speedy triumph of brotherhood and
interchange; but, by some association
of ideas which we do not pretend to
understand, the Free-trader of Meudon
shortly became chief of that
government which established the
communist National Workshops. We
have waited in vain to hear from
any statesman of note a criticism
on the President's most Protectionist
Message, or any decided expression
of dissent; and why is this? Because
the French people, the small
proprietors, the peasantry, the workmen
of Lyons and Mulhausen, the
manufacturers "of woollen<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> cloths
and tissues, of cotton cloths, leather,
earthenware, glass, and objects of
luxury, have found ready and advantageous
markets" under the existing
system, and are prepared to defend
Protection to the last drop of their
blood. The rulers of such a people
know, that to deprive their labour of
Protection is but to inaugurate the
reign of Communism, to establish
anarchy, and to insure their own
immediate downfall.</p>

<p>So much for the Liberal states of
Europe. Let us next turn to America,
wherein no corrupt aristocracy sheds
its baneful influence upon society;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>where an unsectarian and generous
instruction is given by the State to
all; where no standing army is at
hand, first to inflame, and then to
gratify the unwise lust of conquest;
where the people are really the source
of power, and a free press enlightens
them as to its proper exercise. There
surely, if anywhere, we shall find
political economic truth enshrined in
the heart and tariff of the nation,
and the pestilent heresies of Protection
given up to the ridicule of a
wise and discerning community. A
glance at the present tariff, and
an examination into the relations
between "the plough, the loom, and
the anvil," on the other side of the
Atlantic, may consequently afford
some useful information to us who
are now subjected to a policy which
is sacrificing the first to the two other
members of that great industrial
triad. Mr Carey, the well-known
statistical writer of America, has, in
<i>The Harmony of Interests</i>, supplied
us with ample materials for conducting
such an inquiry; and we can
safely recommend his remarkable
work to all who wish to investigate
the causes of the progress and decline
of industrial communities.</p>

<p>Governor Pownell in 1769, arguing
in the House of Commons against
taxing our North American provinces,
had the prophetic wisdom to
foresee&mdash;what some few American
politicians of the present day, and the
leaders of our own Manchester school
do not yet seem rightly to comprehend&mdash;that
the time must inevitably
come when America would cease to
depend upon English industry for
manufactured goods. "They will
abominate," said he, addressing himself
to the people of England, "as
sincerely as now they love you; and
if they do, they have within themselves
everything requisite to the
food, raiment, or dwelling of mankind;
they have no need of your
commerce." A dim perception of
this truth has at last impelled the
Manchester Chamber of Commerce&mdash;the
oligarchy by whom the destinies
of this empire are swayed at the
present time&mdash;to despatch a Commissioner
to India in search of cotton-growing
districts, whence they may
obtain certain supplies of the raw
material, and, we hope, of markets
for the manufactured products thereof;
for to us it is evident, that the "model
republic" is henceforth to be relied on
for neither the one nor the other.</p>

<p>Is this a bold or unauthorised assertion?
Let us see. Who has forgotten
the prophecies, or rather the confident
assumption, of that entire and unlimited
reciprocity which was to prevail
between Great Britain and America,
the moment after the former
power announced her intention of
admitting free of import duties the
produce of the latter? Certainly we
have not, though the memories of
many people in Manchester and the
adjacent parts may be more fallacious.
In common fairness we must allow
that, so far as argument could be drawn
from mere hypothesis, the advocates
of Free Trade were entitled to make
the most of America. No other country
could afford them so plausible a
plea for reciprocity. Through absolute
necessity, the cotton manufacturers
of Great Britain depended upon
America for their yearly supply of raw
material. America hitherto had taken
a large proportion of our manufactured
goods&mdash;being content that the cotton,
before it reached her in a textile fabric,
should twice cross the waters of the
Atlantic; and she also was a large
customer for our coal, our iron, and
other commodities. The terms were
still unequal, at least for endurance.
Britain could not do&mdash;at least Manchester
and its dependencies could not&mdash;without
the supply of cotton wool;
but how if America, by rearing factories
and furnaces, could contrive to
do without either our calicoes, or our
coal, or our iron? For a long time it
was supposed that this was impossible&mdash;that
the Americans had not sufficient
capital to embark in manufacturing
pursuits&mdash;and that nature had denied
them those plentiful stores of coal and
iron which are to be found in the British
islands. The following tables,
brought down to the latest accessible
dates, will demonstrate the fallacy of
that idea:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the increase here exhibited
lies the reason why the League made
such a desperate, and unfortunately
successful, effort to overthrow the
whole protective system of Great
Britain; and also the reason why
America refuses reciprocity. The
Manchester men began to see&mdash;there
being no want of shrewdness among
them when their own individual interests
were concerned&mdash;that their
game had not only become hazardous,
but must ere long prove desperate.
They had already many rivals on the
continent of Europe, who were, equally
with themselves, customers to the
Americans for cotton wool, and who
fenced themselves against the introduction
of the Manchester fabric by
hostile tariffs. That, however, was
nothing in comparison to the appalling
fact, that the very people who found
the raw material were actually in
possession of the means of spinning
it themselves, and seemed bent on
doing so by their progress from year
to year! In vain did our manufacturers
and chambers of commerce try
to demonstrate to the Yankees that
they were not only committing a foolish
but a most unnatural action&mdash;in
vain did they assert, as a fundamental
doctrine of ethics, that Britain ought
to have the manufacturing monopoly
of the world; and as a fundamental
principle of economy, that it was far
more for the advantage of a nation
which produced the raw material to
forego its manufacture, than to rear
up within itself a new and lucrative
branch of industry. Their ethics and
their economy were alike scouted; and
no wonder, for both propositions were
repugnant to common sense, to ascertained
results, and to reason. If it is
indeed a law of economy that a nation
which produces the raw article ought
to confine itself to that production,
and not to undertake the finishing and
manufacturing process&mdash;then, by the
same reasoning which was attempted
to be palmed off upon the Americans,
our wool, instead of being made up at
Leeds or Bradford, should be straightway
shipped off to Saxony; and the
product of our iron mines transported
to Sweden, there to undergo the necessary
process of smelting. It is perhaps
the strangest feature of the age
in which we live, that such absolute
and self-evident nonsense as this
should not only have been uttered on
platforms, and received with applause
by crowds of congregated merchants,
but have been gravely set forth in our
public journals as a doctrine of the
highest value.</p>

<p>There is, however, no such thing as
a universal code of political economy.
The Americans listened and laughed,
and ran up their factories faster than
ever, and ransacked the bowels of the
earth for their inestimable strata of
minerals, believing with a proper faith
that they would not have been placed
there unless it was intended that man
should convert them to his use. Our
cotton manufacturers, being thus situated,
had some reason to despond.
The nation that gave them their raw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
material, and that was also their best
customer for fabrics, seemed on the
very point of deserting them in both
ways. True, a much greater quantity
of cotton than was ever yet grown
might be raised in America, but then
the demand, though great in itself, has
limits; and an unusually large crop
has the effect of extinguishing profit
to the grower. This will be better
understood by the American estimate
of the value of crops:&mdash;</p>

<p>The estimate for the latter year,
says Mr Carey, was that made at
New Orleans before the occurrence of
the frosts and freshets, which, we presume,
raised the price of cotton wool.
We see, however, from this, that the
small yield of 1847 was infinitely
more profitable to the grower than
the large yield of 1845, and this will
explain the reason why the culture of
cotton cannot be indefinitely extended.
It therefore became necessary,
at all hazards, if cotton-spinning
in Britain was to be maintained in its
former palmy state, that some further
concession should be made to America,
to bribe her, since she could not be
forced to abstain from the encouragement
of her own manufactures.</p>

<p>That bribe was the removal of the
import duties on grain and provisions
to Great Britain. Let the secret
instigators of the movement&mdash;the men
who organised the machinery of the
League&mdash;disguise the fact as they
may, that, and that alone, was the
actual cause of our lowered tariffs
and the ultimate repeal of the corn-laws.
The Manchester Chamber
hoped&mdash;most vainly, as it now appears&mdash;that,
by giving a new stimulus to
agriculture in America, at the expense
of the vast body of British
producers, they could at least ward
off the evil day when the American
manufacturer should be able to annihilate
their trade, by depriving them
of the enormous profits which they
realised on the conversion of the raw
material into yarn. What these profits
were will appear from the fact
that the price of cotton wool at Liverpool,
in 1843-4, was 6d., whilst twist
was selling at 10<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>d.; and that in
1844-5, the price of wool having
fallen to 4d., the market value of
twist was 11<sup><small>3</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>d. Hitherto the prices,
as fixed in England, have regulated
those of the world.</p>

<p>That the late Sir Robert Peel, himself
a scion of the cotton interest,
should have been swayed by such
considerations, is not, perhaps, remarkable;
but that any portion of the
landed gentry, of the producers for
the home market, the labourers and
the mechanics of Great Britain, should
have allowed themselves to be deceived
by the idea, that diminished or
depreciated production could possibly
tend either to their individual or to
the national advantage, will hereafter
be matter of marvel. We who know
the amount of artifice and misrepresentation
which was used, and who
never can forget the guilty haste with
which the disastrous measure was
hurried through both Houses of Parliament,
without giving to the nation
an opportunity of expressing its deliberate
opinion, feel, and have felt,
less surprise than sorrow at the event.
With British feeling, however, we
have at present nothing to do; our
object is to trace the effect which our
relaxation has exercised upon American
policy.</p>

<p>These duties are somewhat lower,
though not materially so, than the former
tariff of 1842; but they certainly
offer no inconsiderable amount of
protection to home industry and produce.
We have already seen the
progress which has been made by the
American cotton manufacturers, iron-masters,
and miners; and it is now
quite evident that, unless that progress
is checked&mdash;which it only can be by
the will of the Americans&mdash;our exports
to that quarter must naturally decline.
This is not our anticipation merely;
it has been expressed openly and
anxiously in the columns of the Free-Trade
journals. In the iron districts
of Scotland and Staffordshire, the
apprehension that henceforward the
American market will be generally
closed against them, is, we know,
very prevalent; and the following
extract from the report of the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, (April 11, 1850,) on the
condition and prospects of the iron
trade in the spring of 1850, applies
exactly to the opening of 1851:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The present state of our commercial
negotiations with the United States, particularly
in relation to the exportation of
iron from this country, promises greatly
to aggravate existing evils. It is feared
by many largely interested in the iron
manufacture of this neighbourhood, that
the efforts of Sir Henry Bulwer at Washington
to obtain a modification of the
American tariff, with respect more especially
to the importation of iron, will
prove abortive for some time to come.
Our exports of iron from South Staffordshire
are said to be already considerably
reduced; and should our Transatlantic
friends continue, as they threaten, their
restrictive commercial policy, business in
these important manufacturing districts
must of necessity be still more limited
than it is at the present moment."</p></div>

<p>What the prospects are of future
relaxation may be gathered from the
following extract from the message of
President Fillmore to Congress, which
has reached us whilst writing this
article. We observe that the <i>Times</i>
is bitterly chagrined to find that the
President "has stated and commended
the false doctrine of Protection." Was
it to be expected that he would have
done otherwise, seeing that the vast
majority of the American public are
thoroughly imbued with the same
doctrines, however false and heretical
they may appear in the eyes of Manchester?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"All experience has demonstrated the
wisdom and policy of raising a large portion
of revenue for the support of Government
from duties on goods imported.
The power to lay these duties is unquestionable,
and its chief object, of course, is
to replenish the Treasury. But if, in
doing this, an incidental advantage may
be gained by encouraging the industry of
our own citizens, it is our duty to avail
ourselves of that advantage.</p>

<p>"A duty laid upon an article which
cannot be produced in this country, such
as tea or coffee&mdash;adds to the cost of the
article, and is chiefly or wholly paid by
the consumers. But a duty laid upon an
article which may be produced here
stimulates the skill and industry of our
own country to produce the same article,
which is brought into the market in competition
with the foreign article, and the
importer is thus compelled to reduce his
price to that at which the domestic article
can be sold, thereby throwing a part of
the duty upon the producer of the foreign
article. The continuance of this process
creates the skill, and invites the capital,
which finally enable us to produce the article
much cheaper than it could have been
procured from abroad, thereby benefiting
both the producer and the consumer at
home. The consequence of this is, that
the artisan and the agriculturist are
brought together; each affords a ready
market for the produce of the other, the
whole country becomes prosperous, and
the ability to produce every necessary of
life renders us independent in war as well
as in peace.</p>

<p>"A high tariff can never be permanent.
It will cause dissatisfaction and will be
changed. It excludes competition, and
thereby invites the investment of capital
in manufactures to such excess, that when
changed it brings distress, bankruptcy,
and ruin upon all who have been misled
by its faithless protection. What the
manufacturer wants is uniformity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
permanency, that he may feel a confidence
that he is not to be ruined by sudden
changes. But, to make a tariff uniform
and permanent, it is not only necessary
that the law should not be altered, but
that the duty should not fluctuate. To
effect this, all duties should be specific,
wherever the nature of the article is such
as to admit of it. <i>Ad valorem</i> duties
fluctuate with the price, and offer strong
temptations to fraud and perjury.</p>

<p>"Specific duties, on the contrary, are
equal and uniform in all ports and at all
times, and offer a strong inducement to
the importer to bring the best article, as he
pays no more duty upon that than upon one
of inferior quality. I therefore strongly
recommend a modification of the present
tariff, which has prostrated some of our
most important and necessary manufactures,
and that specific duties be imposed
sufficient to raise the requisite revenue,
making such discrimination in favour of
the industrial pursuits of our country as
to encourage home production without
excluding foreign competition. It is also
important that an unfortunate provision
in the present tariff, which imposes a much
higher duty upon the raw material that
enters into our manufactures than upon
the manufactured article, should be remedied."</p></div>

<p>So that America, the great democratic
state on which we relied for
reciprocity, is going ahead, not, as
our Free-Traders foretold, in their
direction, but precisely on the opposite
tack.</p>

<p>What is there wonderful in this?
Was it likely that a country, possessing
within itself the raw material in
abundance, and, so far as cotton was
concerned, having a virtual monopoly
of its growth, should for ever refuse
to avail itself of its natural advantages,
and to stimulate agriculture by
giving it that enormous increment of
consumption which must arise from
the establishment of domestic manufactures?
Does not common sense
show us that, the nearer the point of
exchange can be brought to the exchanging
parties, the more advantageous
and profitable to both parties
must that interchange necessarily
become? Unquestionably it is for the
interest of the American planter to
have the manufactory brought as
close as possible to his plantation,
seeing that thereby he would avoid
the enormous charges which he bears
at present, both in land carriage and
freightage&mdash;charges which, of themselves,
go a great way towards the
annihilation of his profit. Add to
this that those charges on the raw
material necessarily enhance the price
of the fabric when converted by
British machinery, and again transported
to America, and it must become
evident to every one how largely
the American planter is interested in
the foundation and success of American
manufactures. The interest of
the agriculturist is equally great.
For him a steady market at his own
door, such as extended manufactures
alone can give, is the readiest and
most certain source of wealth and
prosperity. What he wants is regular
consumption, and the nearer the
customers can be found, the greater
will be the demand, and the more profitable
the supply.</p>

<p>We need not, however, argue a
matter which has been already settled
on the other side of the Atlantic. It
suffices us to know that, in all human
probability, America will persevere
as she has begun, taking every advantage
which we are foolish enough
to give her, and yet adhering to her
system of protecting domestic labour,
and of riveting more closely than
before all branches of industry by the
bonds of mutual interest. Such clear,
distinct, and philosophic principles as
are enunciated by a late American
writer make us blush for the confused,
absurd, and contradictory jargon
which of late years has been proffered
to the world, with so much parade,
as the infallible dicta of British political
economy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A great error exists in the impression
now very commonly entertained in regard
to national division of labour, and which
owes its origin to the English school of
political economists, whose system is
throughout based upon the idea of making
England 'the workshop of the world,'
than which nothing could be less natural.
By that school it is taught that some
nations are fitted for manufactures and
others for the labours of agriculture; and
that the latter are largely benefited by
being compelled to employ themselves in
the one pursuit, making all their exchanges
at a distance, thus contributing
their share to the maintenance of the
system of 'ships, colonies, and commerce.'
The whole basis of their system is <i>conversion</i>
and <i>exchange</i>, and not production,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
yet neither makes any addition to the
amount of things to be exchanged. It is
the great boast of their system that the
exchangers are so numerous and the producers
so few; and the more rapid the
increase in the proportion which the
former bear to the latter, the more rapid
is supposed to be the advance towards
perfect prosperity. Converters and exchangers,
however, must live, and they
must live out of the labour of others; and
if three, five, or ten persons are to live
on the product of one, it must follow that
all will obtain but a small allowance of
the necessaries and comforts of life, as is
seen to be the case. The agricultural
labourer of England often receives but
eight shillings a-week, being the price of
a bushel and a half of wheat.</p>

<p>"Were it asserted that some nations
were fitted to be growers of wheat and
others grinders of it, or that some were
fitted for cutting down trees, and others
for sawing them into lumber, it would be
regarded as the height of absurdity, yet
it would not be more absurd than that
which is daily asserted in regard to the
conversion of cotton into cloth, and implicitly
believed by tens of thousands
even of our countrymen. The loom is as
appropriate and necessary an aid to the
labours of the planter as is the grist-mill
to those of the farmer. The furnace is
as necessary and as appropriate an aid to
the labours of both planter and farmer as
is the saw-mill; and those who are compelled
to dispense with the proximity of
the producer of iron labour are subjected
to as much disadvantage as are those who
are unable to obtain the aid of the saw-mill
and the miller. The loom and the
anvil are, like the plough and the harrow,
but small machines, naturally attracted
by the great machine, the earth; and
when so attracted all work together in harmony,
and men become rich, and prosperous,
and happy. When, on the contrary,
from any disturbing cause, the attraction
is in the opposite direction, and the small
machines are enabled to compel the products
of the great machine to follow
them, the land invariably becomes poor,
and men become poor and miserable, as
is the case with Ireland."</p></div>

<p>In short, the American system is,
to stimulate production by creating a
ready market at home, and, as the
best means of creating that market,
to encourage the conversion of the
raw material within the United
States, by laying on a protective duty
on articles of foreign manufacture.
The British system now is, to discourage
home production, and to
sacrifice everything for the desperate
chance of maintaining an unnatural
and fortuitous monopoly of conversion,
not of our own raw material
only, but of that of other countries.
In the attempt to secure this exceedingly
precarious advantage&mdash;which, be
it remembered, does not conduce to
the prosperity of the great majority
of the nation&mdash;our rulers and politicians
have deliberately resolved that
agriculture shall be rendered unprofitable;
and that the bulk of our artisans,
who can look to the home
market only, shall henceforward be
left unprotected from the competition
of the whole world. It needs little
sagacity to predict which system is
based upon sound principles; or
which, being so based, must ultimately
prevail. Our economists never
seem to regard the body of British
producers (who, as a class, are very
slightly interested in the matter of
exports) in the light of important
consumers. If they did so, they could
not, unless smitten by judicial blindness,
fail to perceive that, by crippling
their means, and displacing their
labour, they are in effect ruining the
home market, upon which, notoriously,
two-thirds even of the converters
depend. The stability of every state
must depend upon its production, not
upon its powers of conversion. The
one is real and permanent, the other
liable to be disturbed and annihilated
by many external causes. A country
which produces largely, even though
it may not have within it the means
of adequate conversion, is always in
a healthy state. Not only the power,
but the actual source of wealth is
there; and, as years roll on, and
capital accumulates, the subsidiary
process of conversion becomes more
and more developed, not to the injury
of the producer&mdash;but to his great and
even incalculable advantage.</p>

<p>The natural power of the production
of Great Britain, as compared with
other states, is not very high. Its
insular position, and the variableness
of its climate, renders the quality of
our harvests uncertain; but that uncertainty
is perhaps compensated, on
the average, by our superior agriculture,
and the vast pains, labour, and
capital which have been expended on
the tillage of our land. Our meadows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
downs, and hill pastures have, however,
been most valuable to us in furnishing
a better quality of wool than
can elsewhere be obtained in Europe&mdash;an
advantage which our forefathers
perceived and wisely availed themselves
of&mdash;for, as early as the reign of
Edward III., manufacturers from
Hainault were brought into this
country by the advice of Queen Philippa,
and laid the foundation of the
most prosperous, healthy, and legitimate
trade which we possess. Ever
since, the woollen manufacture has
been inseparably connected with the
interests of the British soil. Few
luxuries, or even such articles of
luxury as are now considered necessaries,
can be grown in Great Britain.
For wine our climate is unsuited; but
there is nothing whatever to prevent
us&mdash;except a system which calls itself,
though it is not, Free Trade&mdash;from
growing the coarser kinds of
tobacco, and from establishing manufactories
of sugar from beet-root.
Our stock of minerals is great&mdash;almost
inexhaustible&mdash;and to this fact
we must look for our singular pre-eminence
during so many years in
Europe. Our unlimited supply of
coal and iron gave us an advantage
which no other European nation possessed&mdash;it
was, in fact, virtually a
monopoly&mdash;and upon that we built
our claim to become the workshop of
the world. Nor was the claim in any
degree a preposterous one. That
singular monopoly of minerals&mdash;for
such it seemed&mdash;gave us the actual
power, if judiciously used, of controlling
the process of conversion, not only
here, but elsewhere throughout the
globe. Manual labour, it mattered
not what was the distance, had no
chance at all against the triumphs of
machinery; and hence our commerce
extended itself far and wide, to savage
as well as civilised nations, and
our arms were used to force a market
where it could not otherwise be obtained.
This, if not our strength,
was undoubtedly the cause of our
supremacy, and even of our extended
colonisation; and as we obtained command
of a raw material of foreign
growth, so did we adapt our machinery
to convert it into fabrics for the
world.</p>

<p>It is by no means a pleasant matter
to recur to certain particulars in our
commercial and manufacturing history.
We found the East Indies in the possession
of a considerable manufacture
of cotton, the producer and the converter
being there reciprocally dependant.
<i>That</i> we have stopped, the
object being to compel the Hindustani
to receive his clothing direct from
Manchester. And we have succeeded
so far that, last year, our exports to
Hindostan were so great, that, by
lumping them in the general account,
our statists were able to furnish what
appeared to many a convincing argument
in favour of Free Trade, though
in reality it had nothing to do with
that question. <i>But at what cost</i> have
these operations been made on India?
Simply at this, that, whilst destroying
the native manufacture, we have also
curtailed the production of the raw
material. Of the rapid diminution in
its amount let the following figures
tell:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">IMPORT OF COTTON FROM INDIA TO ENGLAND.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="IMPORT OF COTTON FROM INDIA TO ENGLAND.">

  <td class="tdc">"</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>But raw material we must have,
else our machinery is of no use. We
have had so long a monopoly of cotton-spinning
that we have accustomed
ourselves, spite of nature, and spite of
fact, to believe that our whole destiny
was that of cotton-spinning. We
ignore all history in favour of that
particular shrub; and, pinning our
faith to export tables&mdash;concocted by
the weakest and most contemptible
of charlatans&mdash;we make no hesitation
in avowing that the prosperity
and destiny of Great Britain is indissolubly
entwined with our monopoly
of cotton twist! That would
be simply laughable, if we had not
absolutely legislated on, and committed
ourselves to that theory. We
stand just now, in the face both
of Europe and America&mdash;we know
not whether we ought to exclude the
other quarters of the globe&mdash;in the
most ridiculous possible position.
Our economists are permitted to
say to them&mdash;"Send us your raw
material, and we shall be proud and
happy to work it up for you. Don't
be at the pains or the cost of rearing
manufactories for yourselves. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
would entail upon you, not only a
great deal of trouble, but a vast
expenditure of capital, which you
had much better lay out in improving
your extra soil, and in bringing
it to good cultivation. We can
promise you a ready market here.
Our proprietors and farmers are unquestionably
heavily burdened by
taxation, but they must submit to
the popular will; or, if they choose
to dissent, they may sell off their
stock and emigrate to your country,
where doubtless they will prove valuable
acquisitions. You, we are well
aware, are able to provide us with
food cheaper than they can do it;
and cheapness is all we look to. We
shall even do more for you. We agree
to admit to our market, at merely
nominal duties, all your small articles
of manufacture. You may undersell
and annihilate, if you can, our glovers,
hatters, shoemakers, glass-blowers,
and fifty others&mdash;only do not interfere
with the larger branches, and, above
all, do not touch our monopoly of
cotton."</p>

<p>It is now obvious, and we believe
generally acknowledged by those who
have most practical knowledge of
the subject, that the monopoly is
broken up. America is seriously
addressing herself to the task of
applying her lately discovered stores
of coal and iron to practical use; and,
as we shall presently have occasion
to show, she has no need to train
workmen for that purpose, since the
great emigration from this country
supplies her with practised hands.
That her rivalry will be of the most
formidable description there can be
no matter of doubt, for she will
still be able to retain command of
the raw material, and, retaining
that, to regulate the price of cotton
and cotton goods at New Orleans,
instead of permitting Liverpool or
Manchester to dictate authoritatively
to the world. Whether the Manchester
Chamber, finding their last
move utterly abortive in securing
monopoly, may succeed in rearing
up plantations of cotton elsewhere
than in America, is a point upon
which we cannot speak with any
degree of certainty. That they are
alarmed, and deeply alarmed, at the
prospect before them is evident, not
only from the representations made
in Parliament, and the desponding
tone of their organs, but from the
experiments which they have instituted
for the purpose of ascertaining
whether some other vegetable product
may not be used as a substitute
for cotton. Even if they were successful
in one or other, or in both of
their inquiries, it seems clear to us
that they never can hope to regain
their former ascendency. They must
be exposed to the competition not
only of America, but of the Confederation
of the Zollverein, which
now receives from the United States
a large and increasing supply of raw
material. The following table will
show the extreme rapidity in the
growth of that consumption:&mdash;</p>

<p>Although it never can be agreeable
to know that any important branch of
trade in this country is retrograding
or falling into decay, we cannot affect
to feel much sympathy with the cotton
manufacturers, and that for several
reasons. In the first place, their trade
was a factitious one, not founded upon
or tending in any degree to promote
the real production of Great Britain,
but avowedly rendering us dependant
to a dangerous degree upon foreign
supplies. Secondly, there can be no
doubt that our demand for the raw
material has had the effect of perpetuating
slavery in the southern states of
America. And, lastly, we cannot forget
that we owe all our present difficulties
to the machinations of men connected
with the cotton manufacture. The
doctrine that the strength of Britain
lay in its powers of conversion, not in
its powers of production, originated
with them; and in their selfish eagerness
to maintain a monopoly, even
then in a precarious position, they
made no scruple of sacrificing every
interest which stood in their way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Our readers cannot fall to recollect
the arguments which were
employed by the champions and leaders
of the League. America, whether
as an example or an ally, was never
out of their mouths. We were to
spin for America, weave for America,
do everything in short for her which
the power of machinery could achieve.
America, on the other hand, was to
forego all idea of interfering with our
industrial pursuits, in the way of encouraging
her own children to become
manufacturing rivals, and was to
apply herself solely to the production
of raw material, cotton, corn and provisions,
wherewith the whole of us
were to be fed. Our statesmen acted
on this faith, assured us that we had
but to show the example, and reciprocity
must immediately be established,
and opened the British ports without
any condition whatever. The consequence
was an influx of corn and
provisions far greater than they expected,
which at once annihilated
agricultural profits in Great Britain,
and is rapidly annihilating agriculture
itself in Ireland. We were told to
take comfort, because the very amount
of the importations showed that it
could not be continued; and yet it is
continued up to the present day, and
prices remain at a point which, even
according to the estimate of the Free-traders,
is not only unremunerative,
but so injurious to the grower that he
must lose by the process of cultivation.
The actual labourer was the last
sufferer, but he is suffering now, and
his future prospects are most miserable
and revolting. The smaller branches
of manufacture, and the multitudes of
artisans employed in these, have felt
grievously the effect of lowered tariffs,
and, even still more, the competition
which has been engendered by the
amount of displaced labour. Our
large towns are the natural receptacles
for those who have been driven from
the villages, on account of sheer lack
of employment; and ever and anon
philanthropists are made to shudder
by the tales of woe, and want, and
fearful deprivation, which are forced
upon the public ear. And yet few of
them appear to have traced the evil to
its source, which lies simply in the
legislative discouragement of production,
for the sake of a system of conversion
which can offer no means
adequate to the wants and numbers
of the competing population.</p>

<p>Our exports, when we deduct the
value of the raw material, constitute
in reality an insignificant item in the
account of our annual creation of
wealth. The greatness and prosperity
of Britain never did, and never will,
depend upon the amount of her
foreign trade, though that is now regarded
by our statistical quack-doctors
as the sole criterion. What we must
depend upon is the home trade, and that
can only be prosperous by maintaining
the value of production. For how
else, save from production, are the
labouring population, or indeed any
of us, high or low, rich or poor, as
we may call ourselves, to be maintained?
All of us derive our subsistence
from the earth, and beyond
what is reaped or redeemed from its
bosom we have nothing. If, for
example, there is no market for iron,
the furnaces will be blown out, and
the ores left unworked; if there is no
market for agricultural produce&mdash;that
is, a remunerative market&mdash;the fields
will be left untilled. What, then,
becomes of the converters?&mdash;for
whom do they work?&mdash;or how do
they acquire the wherewithal to purchase
the food which the foreigner
may chance to send them? Let
Ireland answer. That unhappy island
is at this moment paying the last
penalties of Free Trade. It stands
before us as a beacon and warning of
what we must expect, and cannot
avoid, if we continue to discourage
production, in the insane hope of
thereby stimulating conversion; and
perhaps we cannot do better than
quote an American opinion as to the
cause of its wretchedness and ruin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"With this vast increase in the importation
from abroad has come the ruin of
the people of Ireland. Deprived of
manufactures and commerce, her people
were driven to live by agriculture alone,
and she was enabled to drag on a miserable
existence, so long as her neighbour
was content to make some compensation
for the loss of labour, by paying her for
her products higher prices than those at
which they might have been elsewhere
purchased. With the repeal of the Corn
Laws that resource has failed; and the
result is a state of poverty, wretchedness,
and famine, that has compelled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
establishment of a system which obliges
the landowner to maintain the people,
whether they work or not; and thus is
one of the conditions of slavery re-established
in that unhappy country. From
being a great exporter of food, she has
now become a large importer. The
great market for Indian corn is Ireland&mdash;a
country in which the production of
food is almost the sole occupation of the
people. The value of labour in food
throughout a population of eight millions,
is thus rapidly decreasing."</p></div>

<p>To every word of this we subscribe,
and we beg to say, further, that this is
not the only instance. A large portion
of Scotland has been absolutely
pauperised by Free Trade. The
condition of the western Highlands
and Islands is most appalling; and
unless Ministers and members of
Parliament are prepared to do their
duty to the children of the soil, they
are utterly and execrably unworthy
of the trust which has been committed
to their charge. It is with a feeling
nearly akin to loathing that we peruse
accounts of Brobdignag glass-houses,
and sham exhibitions of the industry
of nations, reared at an enormous
cost, when we know that the men
who ought to be the producers of our
national wealth&mdash;and who might be
so, were they not made the victims
of a heartless and senseless system&mdash;are
being driven in hundreds from
their hearths and homes, and cast
upon the wide world, without a roof
to shelter them, or a rag to give them
covering!</p>

<p>All this, and more&mdash;for every day
brings its fresh tale of woe and
wretchedness&mdash;is the consequence of
free imports. And how stands the
account the other way? Where is the
counterbalancing advantage? It may
be that the ruin and prostration of
Ireland and the Highlands is no great
loss to the indwellers of the towns,
the men of the factories and counting-houses.
It may be that they are not
at all affected by such misery, or that
they care to listen to it, notwithstanding
that the victims are in the sight
of God as valuable beings as themselves.
It may be that, in consequence
of such suffering, or rather by
creating it, they have derived some
advantage large enough to compensate
for the havoc, by enabling them to
give a livelihood to thousands who
would otherwise have been unemployed
and destitute. If so, where is
it? Has America reciprocated?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">No! and America will not.</span></p>

<p>America laughs at the whole crew
of Manchester conspirators with sovereign
and undisguised contempt. She
wants nothing from them&mdash;she will
take nothing from them. Secure in
her own position, and possessing within
herself every requisite for greatness,
and&mdash;what is more&mdash;for the
happiness and welfare of her children,
she regards with scorn the attempted
compromise of the crippled converters,
and, while she rejects their offer, gives
them a burning rebuke for their treachery
to their native land.</p>

<p>So far from discouraging her manufactures,
she intends to protect them;
so far from concealing her mineral
wealth, she has resolved to develop
that to the utmost&mdash;judging, and
rightly judging, that it is alone
through the "harmony of interests"
that a nation can be truly prosperous.</p>

<p>Her rebuke, as contained in the
documents before us, which we firmly
believe convey the sentiments of the
wisest men of the Union, is perhaps
the most poignant that ever was cast
in the teeth of a civilised and Christian
community. It resolves itself
into this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You, producers, mechanics, and
artisans of Great Britain, who are
deprived of your labour, which is your
only heritage, for the sake of a few
men, who will neither take your produce
nor avail themselves of your
skill, come to us. We require hands
to till our savannahs, to excavate our
ores, to work at the furnaces, to
weave, and to spin. Labour with us
is not as in your country. The producer
shall not be sacrificed for the
sake of the converter, or the converter
subjected to the precarious mercy of
the producer of another land. Here,
at least, you will find an entire harmony
of interests. Foreign customers
you need seek none, for every
requisite of life is secured to you in
return for your labour."</p>

<p>And, lest it should be thought that
we are putting words into the mouth
of the Americans without authority,
we shall presently have occasion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
quote from the remarkable work
before us.</p>

<p>The repeal of the Corn Laws, and
of the duties levied on provisions,
have enormously, as we all know,
increased the exports of America.

<p>Now, if the doctrine of the Free-traders
is a true one, it will follow
that the imports of America must be
on a scale corresponding to the magnitude
of the exports. If that be so,
the fact will be evident on the face of
their revenue accounts. We turn to
these, and find the following results:&mdash;</p>

<p>How, then, and in what shape,
were these enormous exportations of
grain and provisions paid for? Not
certainly in goods, for if that were so,
a corresponding increase would be
apparent in the revenue accounts.
The answer is quite short&mdash;in gold,
and in that commodity which ought
to be regarded as far more valuable
than gold&mdash;<small>MAN</small>.</p>

<p>It is a fact of no small interest, that
the ship-owning corn-merchants have
willingly sold grain in Liverpool for
less than they could have got for it in
the States, in order to insure the return
cargo&mdash;that which they find so
profitable&mdash;emigrants. Mr Blain,
who was engaged for many years by
the Jews of London and Germany in
valuing the growing crops of America,
gives the following account of this
apparently unreasonable process:&mdash;"The
shipowners of America are
making much money by carrying emigrants
to the States: they are now
extensive corn-merchants, and are
buying largely at very low prices, it
being better to carry wheat across
the Atlantic, and sell it at 2s. per
quarter less than it cost, than buy
ballast, which is very dear in the
American seaports."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Steam, too, is
now about to be applied in furtherance
of this traffic, and we read of
magnificent steamers built expressly
for the corn and emigrant trade between
New York and Liverpool. By
the way, with freights at 6d. a barrel
of flour, (the rate in September 1849,)
equivalent to 1s. per quarter of wheat,
what becomes of the once favourite
sophism, that the Atlantic afforded a
natural protection of at least 10s. to
the English farmer? Nor should it
be forgotten that the American farmer
finds it his plain interest thus to
part with his surplus production, procuring
in return that of which he
stands so much in need&mdash;labour; and
the vast emigration from the western
states to California has rendered
European labour more valuable and
welcome to him than ever.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We imported last year," says Mr
Carey, "about three hundred thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>persons. Estimating their consumption
of food at twenty cents per day for each,
there was thus made a market on the
land for the products of the land to the
extent of <i>twenty millions of dollars</i>. This
transportation required the constant employment
of two hundred and fifty thousand
tons of shipping, and ships carried
freight to Europe at very low rates, because
certain of obtaining valuable return
cargoes. The farmer thus obtained a
large home market, and the power of
exporting cheaply to the foreign one; and
to the conjoined operation of these two
causes is due the fact, that wheat and
flour have continued so high in price.</p>

<p>"We may now, I think, understand
many curious facts now passing before
our eyes. Food is so abundant in Russia,
that it is wasted, and yet among the
large exporters of food to Great Britain
is this country, in which it sells at a price
almost as high as in Liverpool, and now
even higher. The produce of Russia has
to bear all the charges out and home,
and the consequence is that the producer
remains poor, and makes no roads; and
thus the cost of transportation, internal
and external, continues, and must continue
great. The farmer of the United
States sends his produce to market cheap,
because the return cargo, being chiefly
man, is valuable, and the space it occupies
is great. He therefore grows rich,
and makes roads and canals, and builds
steamboats; and thus is the cost of transportation,
internal and external, so far
diminished, that the difference in the
price of a barrel of flour in Pittsburgh
and in Liverpool is, when we look at the
distance, almost inconceivably small.</p>

<p>"The bulk of the trade of Canada is
outwards; and the consequence is that
outward freights are high, while our imports
of men and other valuable commodities
keep them low with us; and therefore
it is that the cost of transporting
wheat and flour from our side of the line
is so much lower than from the other,
that both now pass through New York
on their way to Liverpool. Hence it is
that there has arisen so vehement a desire
for commercial reciprocity, and even
for annexation. The protective system
has thus not only the effect of bringing
consumers to take their places by the
side of the producer, facilitating the consumption
on the land of the products of
the land, and facilitating also the exportation
of the surplus to foreign markets by
diminishing outward freights, but the
further one of producing among our
neighbours a strong desire for the establishment
of the same perfect freedom of
trade that now exists among the several
states, by becoming themselves a part
of the Union. Protection, therefore,
tends to the increase of commerce, and
the establishment of Free Trade; while
the British system tends everywhere to
the destruction of commerce, and to the
production of a necessity for restriction.</p>

<p>"We see, thus, that if we desire to
secure the command of that which is
falsely termed 'the great grain-market of
the world,' it is to be effected by the
adoption of such measures as will secure
valuable return freights. The most costly
and the most valuable of all are men; the
least so are pig-iron and coal. The more
of the latter we import, the larger will
be our surplus of food, the higher will be
the outward freight, internal and external,
the greater will be the waste, and
the poorer will be the farmer. The more
of the former we import, the smaller will
be our surplus of food, the lower will be
the outward freights, and the more numerous
will be the commodities that can
go to Europe, to be given in exchange for
luxuries that now we cannot purchase."</p></div>

<p>So much for the American views
of reciprocity. Secured by her system
of tariffs, which she is now about
to heighten, against the effects of
foreign competition, America is resolutely
bent on availing herself to the
utmost of all the vast natural resources
which she possesses, and to
render herself wholly independent of
the conversion of foreign countries.
By following such a course she must,
as her population increases, grow in
greatness and in might, as must every
nation wherein labour is estimated
and cherished according to its proper
value, and the rights of the domestic
producer and workman guarded with
untiring vigilance.</p>

<p>One word as to the prospects of the
British farmer. We know from undoubted
authority that in many parts
of the United States, for example
Ottawa, excellent land may be purchased
for &pound;1 an acre, broken up for
7s., burdened by no poor nor county
rates, and unconscious of the presence
of the tax-gatherer. Land such as this
can, indeed, afford to produce corn at
an almost nominal price&mdash;ballast for
the ships that shall bring back the
overweighted and ruined yeomen and
peasants of England to New York and
New Orleans! But, vast as the immigration
has been, the production of
food has greatly outstripped it; and
as fresh tracts of virgin land are, year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
by year, brought into cultivation, and
internal communications opened or
improved, we see no reason whatever
to believe that the export of grain to
England will diminish, or the price of
that grain be enhanced. Let our
readers bear in mind the wonderful
development of the mining and manufacturing
resources of America, to
which we have just directed their
attention, and then see how, in spite
of, or far rather concurrently with
that, the production of food also increased.
We again quote from <i>The
Harmony of Interests</i>. How great
was the increase may be seen by the

<p>Showing an increase of not less than 40
per cent in 7 years, during which the
population only advanced 23 per cent.</p>

<p>How much of this surplus produce
may be expected to find its way into
the English market, we do not pretend
accurately to foretell; but when we
find that, without the inducement of
an unrestricted access to it, in 1846
America was able to raise her exports
of grain to thirteen millions of bushels,
from six millions in 1845; and in
1847, with only the preparation of a
year, to twenty-six millions, we think
Lord Fitzwilliam is quite justified in
taking it for granted that the price of
corn in England will not rise above
its present ruinous average. Attempts,
no doubt, will be made to
show that the emigration to California
has deprived the Western States of
the labour that is required to raise
these enormous crops. Our answer is,
that 300,000 souls were added by
immigration to the population of the
United States in 1849; and that our
own emigration returns for 1850 show
that the tide from England is flowing
in that direction with unabated force.
So last year, when the great and
unexpected import of French flour
was adding to the depression, and
stimulating the complaints of the
English agriculturists, the Free Import
authorities explained it away as
a forced unnatural importation which
must speedily cease, as France was
an importing, and not an exporting,
county, and the price of corn there
was naturally higher than in England;
and yet we learn from the
same organ of public opinion which
favoured us in the summer with this
satisfactory explanation of the French
importations, that in the month of
November last, the prices of wheat,
flour, and bread were all much
higher in London than in Paris. In
its City article of November 14th,
appeared the following comparison of
the present prices of wheat, flour,
and bread, in London and Paris:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The highest price of wheat of the
first quality in Paris is 24 francs per
1&frac12; hectolitres, which is equal to 36s. 8d.
per quarter; and the highest price of
white wheat of the first quality, in London,
being 48s. per quarter, it follows
that wheat is 30<sup><small>7</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>8</small></sub>
 per cent dearer in
London than in Paris. The highest
quotation of flour of the first quality in
Paris is 29 francs 95 cents the 100
kilogrammes, which is equal to 29s. 11d.
per sack of 280 lb. English; and the
highest quotation of flour in the London
market being 40s. per sack, it follows
that flour is about 33<sup><small>5</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>8</small></sub>
 per cent
dearer in London than in Paris. The
price of bread of the first quality in
Paris is 27 cents per kilogramme, which
is equal to 4<sup><small>5</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>8</small></sub> per 4 lb. loaf English
weight; and the price of bread in London,
at the full-priced shops, being 6<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>d.
per 4 lb., it follows that bread is 40<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>
 per
cent dearer in London than in Paris."</p></div>

<p>We apprehend that a difference of
thirty or forty per cent is sufficient
to tempt the French corn-grower, or
miller, into the higher-priced market
which lies so conveniently open to
him; and thus from the model republic
of the Old, no less than from
the model republic of the New World,
must the English farmer expect to
see for the future those supplies of
grain and flour pouring in, which shall
prevent his produce procuring a remunerating
price. To complete the
picture, it should not be forgotten
that both these exporting countries
impose considerable duties on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
importation of grain and flour, and
thus afford us a perfect specimen of
that reciprocity which all Liberal
governments and free nations were so
anxious to establish, according to our
sapient rulers, in 1846.</p>

<p>We do not think that we need add
any further argument to what has
been already said. Our antagonists,
the Free-traders, have been allowed&mdash;what
they required and what was
fair&mdash;time for the working of their
experiment. Ample time has been
granted, and we now see that it has
failed in every particular. They
said that it would induce reciprocity;
it has induced higher opposing tariffs.
They said it would secure for Great
Britain the manufacturing custom of
the world; on the contrary, foreign
manufactories are springing up with
unexampled rapidity. They said it
would increase the demand for iron;
it has prostrated it. They said it
would give full employment to all
our labouring population; it has displaced
labour, and driven our working
men by hundreds of thousands to
emigrate. They said it could not
attract such an importation of foreign
grain and provisions, as permanently
to beat down prices in this country
below the remunerating level; it has
already brought such an influx of
these articles, that the grower of
grain is impoverished, and the breeder
of cattle ruined. They said it would
be the commencement of a new era
of prosperity to Ireland; it has laid
it utterly desolate!</p>

<p>Are we, then, obstinately to persevere
in a course of policy so evidently
obnoxious and detrimental? Are we
still to crush down labour for an end
which is now proved to be impossible
of attainment; and to tell the working
classes, that because our rulers
have made a false step, they and
theirs must submit to descend into the
hideous gulf of pauperism? These are
questions for the nation to consider&mdash;questions
of unparalleled magnitude,
both for the present and the coming
time. If we are not so to persevere
in our folly, there is no alternative left
but to build up our commercial system
anew upon wiser and sounder principles.
It cannot be expected that we
shall ever again possess a monopoly of
the manufactures of the world. We
must be contented with that share
which our skill, and energy, and undeniable
resources can command; and
if we wish still to retain possession
of the vast Colonial Empire which has
long been our pride and boast, we
must foster, stimulate, and protect the
industry of the colonists as sedulously
and anxiously as our own.</p>

<p>After all, we may possibly, at no
very distant period of time, have
reason to be thankful that the experiment
has been made, notwithstanding
all the misery and loss which
have accompanied the trial. For, if
anything could have broken down
the free independent spirit of Great
Britain, and rendered it callous and
listless to external aggression or insult,
no better method could be found
than the complete adoption of a system
which must have made us perpetually
subservient to the wants of
other nations, doing their work to
order, and receiving wages in return.
In order to emancipate ourselves
from this state of threatened Helotism&mdash;the
state which the disciples of the
Manchester school regard as the most
enviable upon earth&mdash;we must attempt
to re-establish perfect harmony
and mutual co-operation amongst
all the interests of Britain, to give
productive labour its proper place
and pre-eminence, and, since we cannot
secure for convertive labour the
command of foreign markets, to take
care that, in the home market, it is
not exposed to any undue or unfair
competition. We hold by this proposition,
well understood and energetically
supported in America, that
"when a nation makes a market at
home for nearly all its products, other
nations have to come and seek what
they require, and pay the highest
price; and that, when it does not
make a market at home, markets
must be sought abroad, and then
sales must be made at the lowest
prices." If this be true, it will follow
that the way to sell at the highest
prices, and to buy at the lowest, is to
buy and sell at home.</p>
